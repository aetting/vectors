focus today is coming up in a minute .
hello , dear viewers , welcome to focus today .
on november 22 , the british newspaper daily mirror revealed that us president bush once planned to bomb the al - jazeera tv station headquarters , setting off a mighty uproar .
the two british nationals charged with leaking the information already appeared in court for interrogation yesterday for the first time .
according to a report by the british newspaper the guardian , al - jazeera tv station is now considering suing us president bush for this matter .
well , what exactly was this incident ?
why has al - jazeera tv station become a thorn in bush 's side ?
these are all the topics we will be focusing on today .
two honorable guests have been invited to our studio . let me give you an introduction .
one is mr. ruan zongze , vice director of the china institute of international studies . mr. ruan zongze has done extensive researches on british and us issues .
the other is mr. wu huixuan , former cir chief correspondent based in qatar .
hello !
welcome you two to the studio for our interview .
well , at the start of today 's program , let 's learn about the full context of this incident together .
we will first talk about the daily mirror article that started it .
what we are seeing now on screen is a very popular newspaper in britain called the daily mirror .
next , let 's see ; this is a november 22 article .
the title goes like this :
exclusive report : bush planned to bomb his arab ally
well , let 's now look at the content of the article .
the article writes that the minutes of a meeting between british prime minister blair , who was visiting the us on april 16 , 2004 , and us president bush at the white house showed that bush had intended to take military actions against al - jazeera tv station headquartered in the qatari capital of doha .
then , blair said to bush that such an action would trigger a worldwide uproar .
these are some records of the conversation between the two men .
let 's now look at this article .
a paragraph in the article writes -- let 's look at this line marked with a black frame , which writes : undoubtedly bush wanted to do this .
and equally without doubt , blair did not want him , that is , bush , to do this .
well , it happened , er , that our correspondent did an interview at the al - jazeera 's beijing office today and happened to videotape the image we are watching now , which was broadcast live by al - jazeera tv station . it was the news about bush 's plan to bomb al - jazeera tv station .
so what we are seeing on screen was exactly transmitted by al - jazeera tv station .
well , yesterday the two british nationals involved in the disclosure of the incident were interrogated by the court . well , here is the scene of the two persons under interrogation .
in the meantime , al - jazeera tv station also protested several times upon learning the information .
well , this is a brief introduction of the context of the incident .
well , regarding this topic , the first question today is that we want to find out clearly whether this incident was real or not .
let 's start with this newspaper .
well , director yuan , i know that you also once worked in britain . well , what kind of newspaper is the daily mirror ?
it is said to have a very large circulation , but people still call it a tabloid . so how accurate is the news carried by it ?
this is true . its circulation should be considered one of the largest among british newspapers .
uh-huh .
but at the same time , interestingly , it is not a mainstream newspaper , either .
uh-huh .
that is why it is called a tabloid , because it does not belong to the mainstream in the current british newspaper industry .
it is still called a tabloid .
it is placed together with other city newspapers , yet it is also a newspaper of national circulation with an extremely powerful influence .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
its influence is mainly on ordinary readers , the general public .
that 's because most british newspapers have their own steady readership .
they have different levels of readership , ah .
right , they have a fairly steady readership .
right .
well , this newspaper is said to have various kinds of topics appropriate to all ages .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
well , so , now we need to seriously consider its authenticity or accuracy .
is the news carried by it credible or not ?
how much is its accuracy , i think , is still quite hard to determine at this time , indeed ,
uh-huh .
because i will mainly speak from two perspectives . first , when the mirror got hold of the news , it called 10 downing street the first night , saying that it had such information .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
well , it meant to find out whether 10 downing street had anything to say , but downing street said it had no comments .
uh-huh .
however , when the news was released , it set off such a mighty uproar .
uh-huh .
this is the first point .
the second point is to look at the reaction of al - jazeera tv station . what al - jazeera tv station is now asking britain to do is to either confirm the news as true or to deny it .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
however , right now , britain has neither said it is true nor said it is not . that is the situation .
it did not confirm anything .
however , there is still one detail . when we introduced the context information , we also mentioned the two staff members involved in the leakage of the information . these two staff members , also considered british government employees , have already been under interrogation .
well , since they are under interrogation , it means they may have indeed divulged the secret .
could this be used to determine that there was indeed such an incident ?
there was such an incident , um , uh-huh .
i think there are two questions involved in this matter . one is whether there is any secret being divulged , and the other is whether the news that bush wanted to bomb al - jazeera tv station is true .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think these are two different questions .
uh-huh .
regarding the leakage of the secret , it seems that the possibility here , ah , is really big .
what secret exactly was divulged ?
um .
because according to the british , um , government , um , its official secrets act section 5 , that is to say , it is illegal for newspapers or media to publicize indiscreetly government information obtained through unauthorized channels .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , well , these two people have already been suspected of violating this section , and that is why they have been sued .
right .
well , of course it is still in a preliminary stage right now , and yesterday a hearing lasting only 15 minutes was held .
uh-huh .
but , both of these two people denied they were guilty .
uh-huh .
so , now it will still have to go through a quite lengthy judicial procedure .
eh , in other words , although they were interrogated , whether the secret leaked was something like our topic today , that is , bush said he wanted to bomb al - jazeera tv station , whether the secret divulged was this record , these are still two different things .
however , it should be closely related to this because this is about the so - called memo .
uh-huh .
it should be closely related .
yeah .
uh-huh .
on april 16 of last year when blair was visiting the us , they had some exchange between them . that was how this memo came into being . it was about five pages long .
right .
uh-huh .
well , in this memo , bush seemed to imply that he probably wanted to bomb this al - jazeera tv station .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
at that time blair tried his best to persuade him not to do it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , but the very authenticity of the incident , i think , still needs to be determined by the british government or us government .
they need to come out for making clarification and judgment .
yeah .
well , mr. wu , we know , ah , you worked as a reporter in qatar and were very familiar with al - jazeera tv station . so how do you look at this incident ? do you think it is real or not ?
um .
i think it is possible that the us wanted to bomb al - jazeera tv station .
uh-huh .
that 's because all the things reported by al - jazeera tv station since its establishment in 1996 were those the us did not want viewers in the world to look at , especially with respect to the afghan war and iraq war .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
what they reported was entirely incompatible with the so - called freedom of the press advocated by the us .
uh-huh .
for instance , the us attacked al - jazeera tv station several times .
it happened once that when bush , er , together with that defense secretary rumsfeld visited qatar , they put pressure , put pressure on the qatari government , saying you should not broadcast these news items that were harmful to the us .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , later , under such circumstances , eh , the director of al - jazeera tv station was replaced once .
uh-huh .
under his pressure .
uh-huh .
but , the leader of al - jazeera tv station , jazeera , ah , qatar replied that we advocate the same freedom of the press as the freedom of the press in your country and that our government has no right to interfere with what is being reported by a private tv station .
that is to say , eh , according to your judgment , this incident was possible because the us has long considered it a thorn in its flesh .
right .
so , to say that the us government or the us president had such an idea , you think many people may easily believe it .
yeah .
there is such possibility .
right , yes .
all right , regarding whether this incident was real or not , according to you two , eh , there is indeed a lot of information .
there are no waves without wind .
yeah .
right , there are no waves without wind . so , this incident probably does have some basis .
some basis .
well , let 's now focus on this al - jazeera tv station .
as a matter of fact , when we watch tv , we can see many news services , ah , including the us cnn and the british bbc , often replaying footage by al - jazeera tv station .
since the al - jazeera tv station logo is on , people should be quite familiar with al - jazeera tv station .
the station logo , right .
yeah .
but how did this al - jazeera tv station rise to fame competing with so many western media outlets in news coverage ?
let 's learn about this through another background video clip .
al - jazeera tv station , established in november 1996 in qatar , is an arabic - language news tv station broadcasting global news and reports nonstop around the clock . its staff all comes from various arab countries , and its viewership has reached 50 million .
prior to its establishment , there has been no arabic - language tv station broadcasting news nonstop around the clock in the arab world .
in september 2001 , the 9 / 11 attacks broke out in the us .
on october 7 , the us and britain launched military strikes on the taliban in afghanistan .
as a result , another news war erupted in the international media community .
when people all over the world expected to watch the live broadcast of the war by the us cnn , they could only see a few blurry images on tv .
meanwhile , however , the little known al - jazeera tv station based in the small gulf country of qatar suddenly emerged to broadcast the progress of the afghan war in arabic language and mobilized its 27 reporting stations all over the world to conduct an around - the - clock follow up coverage .
when the taliban regime announced that reporters from all countries were banned from entering the territory of afghanistan , al - jazeera tv station was the only one that could enter the taliban - controlled area .
taking such an advantage , al - jazeera tv station started to establish its unique leading position in covering the afghan war with its frequent live broadcast of missile attacks on the afghan capital of kabul .
during the war , al - jazeera tv station continued to broadcast exclusive news and images under its logo and sell them to competitors at the high price of 20,000 us dollars per minute .
while the us military searched everywhere for information on bin laden in vain , al - jazeera tv station frequently aired the footage of bin laden making a speech .
mr. wu , we know that you happened to be in qatar when al - jazeera tv station was just established in 1996 .
right .
in addition , you were said to have attended the inaugural broadcast ceremony .
what did al - jazeera tv station look like when it just started broadcasting ?
what kind of news broadcast style was featured at that time ?
er , they held an inaugural broadcast ceremony at the end of november 1996 at that time .
we reporters in qatar were also invited to attend this inaugural broadcast ceremony .
uh-huh .
there were n't many people at the time .
uh-huh .
but at the time of its establishment , this , er , al - jazeera tv station already had a very good foundation in terms of reporters .
uh-huh .
why ?
in 1995 , um , the british bbc 's arabic language tv station was shut down due to funding problems .
uh-huh .
so , al - jazeera tv station seized this opportunity to get hold of this , this entire group of people by hiring them , er , as their reporters , editors , or anchors at high salaries .
uh-huh .
so , they had a relatively good team of reporters .
uh-huh .
well , this way , later it followed that , er , er , three - chinese - character , three , er , six - chinese - character principle of news reporting called , er , independence , neutrality , ah , neutrality , balance , and freedom .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , what it reported was in a completely different style from that of some other arab tv stations .
right .
in this respect , that is , let me add one point , that is , this al - jazeera tv station , ah , its style is very much characterized by direct borrowing from the west , for instance , the two mainstream media outlets .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
one is cnn , and the other is bbc .
yeah .
well , i think that bbc , in particular , has quite a big influence on it .
just now mr. wu mentioned , that is to say , many of its reporters directly came from the middle east channel at that time .
uh-huh .
that was jointly run by bbc and saudi arabia . so it had a very good foundation .
in addition , that is , actually , this al - jazeera tv station has a quite unique structure .
that 's because the emir of this country is called hamad . he studied in britain and therefore had quite a good knowledge of britain 's bbc tv station . he also quite admired it .
so , in this way , it has borrowed some of the bbc style .
for instance , britain 's bbc is a very old tv group established in 1927 .
uh-huh .
though it is funded by the government with many of its properties owned by the government , it still follows the guideline of editorial independence .
uh-huh .
for instance , the top decision - making body of bbc is called the board of directors which are composed of twelve members directly appointed by the queen .
uh-huh .
so al - jazeera tv station has also adopted this structure . it has a top seven - member board of directors .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
however , even if its property , ah , and funds can come from the government , it still relatively has its editorial independence .
eh , but in essence , mr. wu , is it really a private tv station or a government - run tv station ?
er , they themselves claim that it is a private tv station , but in reality it could not have been established without a large amount of financial support given by the government .
that 's because it , eh , has an extremely small number of ads during its around the clock broadcast , ah , tv broadcast .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , in addition , it has such a large team , especially with high , high salaries , er , wages , and reporters based abroad , so many reporters abroad . if the government had not supported such expenditures , eh , it would be impossible for a private tv station to survive .
according to your knowledge , how much is its yearly expenditure ?
it was said that the yearly expenditures seem to be about 7 billion us dollars .
about 7 billion us dollars , that is equivalent to more than 50 billion rmb . we should say this is a very huge financial expenditure .
uh-huh .
extremely large .
yeah .
therefore , some people call it gaining voice but losing money because it has relatively small revenues due to few ads .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but it has a tremendous influence .
right .
so , it appears that it is still not bad in gaining voice as it does achieve some effect .
yeah .
ha .
well , speaking of its influence , we have also noticed that er , during the afghan war , er , because it has the exclusive interview right to enter afghanistan to conduct independent and exclusive interviews , we could say this is one of its advantages .
uh-huh .
it also presented an opportunity to it as well .
well , to the development of a tv station , both opportunity and real strength are actually very important .
well , as al - jazeera tv station has been able to develop into its current status , what do you think has it relied upon so that its competitiveness and influential power can surpass , even surpassed cnn and bbc during the iraq war ?
the greatest feature of al - jazeera tv station is that it is a small station that competes with large ones and has become well - known through wars .
that is , the reason why it can establish itself is that it first relied on the afghan war , and then the iraq war after the 9 / 11 .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , it made full use of these two opportunities .
in addition , as the iraq war occurred right in an arab country , everyone is very much concerned with what is going on in the war . so , this provides it with a large viewership , making it instantly famous .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
besides , it has a lot of resources , including its exclusive coverage right in afghanistan as you mentioned just now .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
in addition , al - jazeera tv station is actually quite unique in the arab region .
for instance , a very tough conflict in this region is the conflict between palestine and israel .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , in general , arabs will not invite the israeli leader to make a speech on their tv .
however , for al - jazeera tv station , it could invite barak , the israeli prime minister at that time , to deliver a speech at al - jazeera tv station . this was unprecedented in the arab world .
right .
uh-huh .
well , this also gave it a very unique perspective .
uh-huh .
so , the reason why it is successful , to put it simply , i think , is that it mainly relies on its own very professional news team .
it has a very talented team , eh .
yeah .
in addition , it also looks at major events as they happen from the unique perspective of the arab region or arab world .
uh-huh .
i think that favorable opportunities and geographical conditions also helped because people involved in the afghan war and the taliban were mostly arabs .
uh-huh .
they were from arab countries . they spoke the arabic language . well , that was the opportunity .
in particular , it was the same with the iraq , iraq war , which took place in iraq .
in the iraq , iraq war , as far as i know , among foreign media teams dispatched to iraq for coverage , i should say , the one from qatar 's al - jazeera tv station was the most powerful .
uh-huh .
it had three reporting stations at that time , one group in the south in basra , well , one group in baghdad , and still another group in the north in mosul .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so it was basically covering the iraq , um , iraq war from all perspectives .
so , it surely surpassed some western media in covering the iraq war in certain areas .
uh-huh .
we could say it owed its success to good opportunities , which it seized ;
yes .
favorable geographical conditions ; that is to say , it happens to be located geographically in the arab world ;
yeah .
and also harmonious human conditions ; that is to say , it has its own very rounded and talented team .
er , that is why it is highly influential and competitive .
however , as it is becoming more and more influential and competitive , it has also become a thorn in the us side .
well , today we should say we have just given an introduction of al - jazeera tv station .
well , next let 's learn about more .
what conflicts are there between al - jazeera tv station and the us ?
why has it become a thorn in the us side ?
since it gained instant fame during the afghan war , the style of al - jazeera tv station in pursuit of the freedom of the press and independence has gradually won widespread international attention .
however , at the same time , the conflict between al - jazeera tv station and the us has been increasing .
according to reports , bush , rumsfeld , and powell repeatedly expressed their strong displeasure with al - jazeera tv station directly to the qatari leaders , demanding its government to restrain it more firmly .
the us government thinks that radicals , anti-american and religious commentators have become frequent guests at al - jazeera tv station . in particular , bin laden has chosen it as his exclusive information release agency , endowing it with a unique advantage .
all these made the us hate and fear al - jazeera tv station at the same time .
officials of the bush administration called it osama 's tv station on different occasions because bin laden 's full name is osama bin laden .
during the iraq war , al - jazeera tv station not only broadcast bush 's and blair 's impassioned pre-war speeches and the image of coalition troops marching toward iraq , but also broadcast the bloody bodies of civilians next to bombed cars .
the video camera scanned over the corpses of coalition troops killed by the iraqi military , and over that little tearful boy with bandages around his head , crying .
if you see the war on the us tv as an electronic game and grand display of smoke and fire , then from the footage by al - jazeera tv station , you see the war only as hell .
do you still remember , ah , during the afghan war and the iraq war , we could often see on screen the al - jazeera footage such as bin laden and some other al - qaeda leaders giving speeches .
ah , moreover , the footage that many other tv stations were using also basically came from al - jazeera tv station .
therefore , at that time americans thought , said that since al - jazeera tv station broadcast these activities of terrorists , it must be colluding with terrorists .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , it was always thought that there seemed to be some subtle relationship between al - jazeera tv station and al - qaeda .
taciturn agreement .
taciturn agreement .
yeah .
taciturn agreement .
right , mr. wu , how do you look at this issue ?
this may have something to do with the good opportunities and favorable geographical conditions mentioned earlier .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
since , er , the taliban people were all arabs , they tried by various means to gain the information so as to expand their own influence .
this has been the consistent practice of al - jazeera station .
uh-huh .
well , the same goes with the iraq war .
they , eh , also speak arabic , right ? another arabic nationality .
uh-huh .
what they reported , eh , was very much welcomed and favored by %pw arab viewers .
uh-huh .
that 's because what they have reported can not be found in the western media reports . that 's why their fame grows .
that is to say , it indeed inspires a kind of patriotic or nationalistic sentiments among arab countries .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think this , this , this point is %pw very important .
in other words , it also benefits from the hard work of al - jazeera tv station .
that is , it is from the perspective of arabs that it looks at the war or also looks at major events .
so , when it makes a report , its perspective , analysis , and its possible outcome or some process of its analysis are different from those of reports by the western mainstream media such as cnn and bbc .
well , it is exactly because of this , even if al - jazeera tv station may not be necessarily linked with any other organizations , simply because it reports the war using a different voice , it has become the target of attacks by the us or the west .
right .
well , regarding this incident , what kind of reaction did al - jazeera tv station have ?
we do n't have much information right now .
but when our correspondents went to have an interview at the al - jazeera tv station 's beijing office today , they asked their office administrator named ezzat , ah , the question why the us threatened to bomb al - jazeera tv station ?
he is also a china expert and speaks excellent chinese .
let 's hear what he said .
i think the reason , er , is -- in the middle east region , in particular , currently , many , some us officials , for instance , many democrat officials , they admitted that the us policies on iraq and the middle east region , eh , region have many mistakes .
er , this point must be acknowledged .
however , up till now , er , the bush administration , it has not constant number , er , er , understood or realized -- they did not want to assume responsibility for what they have done there .
so , it wanted to blame its mistakes in this region on al - jazeera tv station .
second , it is because many -- some things are in conflict with its interests .
however , when i report , i do n't report for the sake of making somebody happy or not making somebody unhappy . this is not my principle , nor is my job .
some of the footage we broadcast did not conform to its interests . so it started to put this restrictive measure in retaliation .
so , the issue is not that al - jazeera tv station is making anti-american reports .
in addition , the us government is carrying out some measures and work against these people in the middle east region and against the world peace .
as you know , we were , eh , reporting the war in fallujah .
our reporter also , eh , almost had an accident there as several shots were purposely , er , fired at him .
then , in the end , er , secretary rumsfeld also directly blamed al - jazeera tv station .
er , who and who , er , most of what the reporter said , er , was groundless .
in the end , later , did we say anything later ? we stopped talking .
we then showed viewers facts and let the images speak by themselves .
we did not do anything at that time . our reporters were forced not to make any commentaries or any reports . we simply showed people the footage about fallujah .
well , the facts may not conform to the interests of mr. bush .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
in fact he mentioned a very important point of view here .
ah ,
uh-huh .
that is to say , this al - jazeera tv station , due to its unique perspective , is different from what is expected of it .
at al - jazeera tv station , there is one , one famous saying , that is , if the whole world listens to cnn , or the whole world watches cnn , then whom does cnn watch or listen to ?
that is also an issue of the right of speech .
well , in fact , the us has long been suppressing al - jazeera tv station .
for instance , the al jazeera tv station 's office in afghanistan was bombed in 2001 .
yeah .
uh-huh .
well , in 2003 , the al - jazeera tv station 's office in baghdad was also bombed .
on april 8 , its reporting station in baghdad was bombed , and one reporter was killed .
yeah .
right .
in addition , currently one of its reporters is still detained by the us at the guantanamo military base .
right .
eh , it was said that a sudanese correspondent from al - jazeera tv station , er , was arrested in afghanistan and has been detained ever since at this , er , us military base at guantanamo .
right .
yeah .
we could say that the us has been suppressing al - jazeera tv station for quite a long time .
yeah .
well , through what ezzat said himself , he also thought he was innocent .
uh-huh .
he basically also blamed it on the us .
well , will al - jazeera tv station really sue us president bush ?
will us president bush have any occasion or opportunity to have this matter clarified ?
would you please analyze how this incident will develop next .
i think that right now it is most likely -- because right now , it has actually entered into a certain judicial procedure in some sense .
uh-huh .
that is to say , the british judicial authority has already brought charges against these two officials , er , suspected of disclosing secret documents .
uh-huh .
well , now we have seen that the director of al - jazeera tv station has also flown to london to demand an explanation from blair .
uh-huh .
to bring up a lawsuit .
right ? that is , i think that right now it is more likely to stay for a while as a topic of public commentaries .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it will stay as a topic of public commentaries , because this involves -- if the us indeed had such a plan , then its so - called %pw , the freedom of speech it advocates will be again greatly discounted .
uh-huh .
we know that the us , like the west , they made a lot of efforts in controlling the right of speech in the international mainstream media .
this reminds me of the year 1999 . during the kosovo war , the us blew up the radio station of milosevic , the former yugoslavia .
uh-huh .
it indeed blew up this radio station of yugoslavia .
right .
then , later , the westerners themselves , including the us , admitted that the reason why it won the kosovo war was to a large extent that they won the other party in public opinion .
uh-huh .
it seems that this incident will again lead to a public opinion war .
uh-huh . after this incident was exposed , ah , al - jazeera tv station , tv station issued a statement last week .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the main idea of the statement was , eh , that al - jazeera tv station has always followed the principle of impartiality , neutrality , and balance in news coverage .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
for that purpose , it is now seriously investigating the news about the us plan to bomb the al - jazeera headquarters in reported by the us newspaper , ah , the british newspaper , and it hopes that the british government can explain this .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right , it seems that this incident , as it develops , will have a lot of things worthy of our attention .
however , as we are running out of time today , let 's end our discussion here .
thank you two very much for participating in our program .
thanks !
uh-huh .
all right , dear viewers , that 's all for today 's edition of focus today .

good-bye .
