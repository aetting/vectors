tonight the legendary mike wallace /.
and this time he answers the questions on everything from the indictment on the cia leak investigation to the president 's new supreme court nominee /.
and he 'll take your phone calls too /.
mike 's next on larry king live /.
before we talk about to mike wallace about his new book let 's check up on the supreme court appointment with senator sam brownbeck republican of kansas /.
he 's a member of the judiciary committee /.
he 'll be voting on the senator /.
he voted for confirming john roberts /.
senator chuck schumer is a democrat of new york member judiciary /.
senator schumer voted against the robert 's nomination /.
and boston is david gergen white house advisor to presidents nixon ford reagen and clinton professor of public service at harvard 's jfk school and editor at large /.
us news and world report will start with david /.
it 's a safe bet that sam brownbeck is going to vote for him and charles schumer is going to vote against him /.
and the question would be why do n't they both wait until the hearing /?
ah because we 've just come through such a contentious period on harriet myerrs and i think that the conservatives really wanted a hard right conservative and now they 've got him /.
they 've all come out and forced a celebrated /-
pat robertson called it a grand slam home run /.
and just as predicated i believe the left is going to come out on the attack /.
i think we 're heading toward a donnybrook /.
it 's going to be really interesting to hear what these two senators have tonight to say about the prospects of a filibuster /.
senator brownbeck do n't the confirmation hearings count /?
or is it over for you /.
he 's got a yes vote /.
the confirmation hearings do count /.
and it 's not over for me /.
i want to see how this nominee performs /.
i want to see what he has to say /.
i just heard his name this morning just started to look at his qualifications his background /.
i think he looks pretty good /.
but i ca n't give you an up or down yes or no now /. that 's part of the process of advise and consent to get more information /.
senator schumer same question for you /.
is it a down automatic /?
no not at all just as sam said /.
(pp-clr-tpc-1 (in on this we agree /.
um we have to see who this nominee is /.
we have to study his record find out uh what he thinks /.
we 'll meet with him personally /.
and then there will be the hearing /.
so you do n't make up your mind /.
obviously people have inclinations /.
my guess is sam 's a little happier with the nomination than i am /.
but neither of us would state our position because we do n't have one /.
you ca n't be sure until you really meet the nominee and see what they 're like /.
uh david gergen if it got to a filibuster how harmful would that be to government /?
well if it gets to a filibuster and i think that 's a very close call tonight whether it will eventually get there or not and the republicans then have made it very clear that they would likely invoke the nuclear option /.
and that is to kill the filibuster and to kill filibusters in general /.
and then we 're going to have tribal warfare in washington /.
we may not get there larry /.
a lot depends /.
uh the hearings do matter /.
people have to look more closely at the record /.
but i think that there 's i think both senators are i think exactly right to say we 're going to wait and hold our positions /.
you can tell by the way both sides are lining up the activists on both sides are lining up that this is going to be a donnybrook /.
senator brownbeck you said that bush picked the best person he could find when he nominated harriet myers /.
does that mean that litos is second best /?
well uh i do n't recall saying that /.
i 'm not sure where your producers came up with that particular statement /.
they came up with it /.
i did n't /.
well huh ok i 'm not sure that was probably attributable to me /.
i had a lot of questions about harriet myers a lot more about /.
there was a lot less of a record on her than there is on judge litos /.
this is one i think we 're going to know a lot more about /.
and i think this is good for the process /.
we should know a judicial philosophy /.
we should have outstanding candidates put forward /.
i think everyone agrees this is an outstanding legal mind /.
and now let 's look at the judicial philosophy /.
i think he probably is a little more conservative /.
he 's probably not as far to the right as ruth bader ginsburgh is to the left /.
uh but let 's take a look /.
and it 's going to take some time to see /.
speaking of that senator schumer did you prefer did you want a woman /?
well all things being equal yes i would have preferred a woman /.
i believe in diversity /.
but uh the president made his choice /.
and sam and i do agree on one thing larry /.
and this is sort of interesting /.
we both agree that the nominee should state their judicial philosophy give us some idea of how he or if it were to be a she thinks on these issues /.
i think the days of the stealth nominee which harriet myers clearly was is over /.
you know supreme court justices have tremendous tremendous power over every one of our lives /.
and the only time you really get to question them see what they think is when the senate has its confirmation process /.
we agree that that ought to happen /.
it ought to happen in a dignified way /.
it ought to happen in thoughtful way /.
but it certainly ought to happen /.
he wo n't make the court if approved until january , right /?
well i think that 's true /.
and you know that 's one thing that does worry me /.
because of the importance of this nomination there should n't be a rush through the procedure /.
some were saying let 's get this done very quickly /.
that does a disservice /.
judge alito is fifty - five years old /.
he 's likely to be on the court for several decades having a huge effect not only on us but on our children maybe our grandchildren /.
and we ought to be careful and thoughtful above all /.
no rush here /.
should n't be /.
david gergen on this program bill clinton said that often judges disappoint the presidents who appoint them because it 's the first time in their life they have a job where they 're not appealed and they also see things differently /.
ah that 's true /.
i do not think that 's the case in this instance because judge alito does have a long record /.
he 's got fifteen years on the court of appeals /.
uh and the one thing we do know about him is that he 's had some forty - one dissents on that court almost always to the right of a court that has been fairly liberal /.
uh and that there so there 's i think he 's got i think he has a consistent philosophy /.
larry my judgment hmm the president deserves to be congratulated for now putting forward someone again who has experience and who is talented /.
there 's no question about that /.
he appears to be quite genial /.
i 'm sure he 'll do pretty well in the hearings /.
my sense is that this is ultimately going to come down to the question is the congress or is the senate going to confirm someone who is going to be a reliable conservative and probably be voting consistently with scalia and thomas or will the democrats be able to block that /?
and that 's going to be that 's going to be and that 's a very big important battle over the judicial philosophy that ought to guide the court /.
senator brownbeck could he be a reliable conservative and still vote to uphold roe vs. wade /?
well i think one could probably look at that /.
but i think that 's an unlikely way to consider it /.
roe vs. wade the right to an abortion that 's read into the constitution is not in the constitution /.
uh and there 's a number of commentators from the left and right that agree that this is not in the constitution /.
it should be debated /.
it should be dealt with by legislators across the country /.
so i think he could read it that way /.
but it seems to me unlikely on somebody that would be more of a strict constructionist on the constitution /.
but he could uphold just on precedent , could he not /?
because he has said in the past that he favors precedent /.
i think almost every judge and justice favors precedent the role of starry decises that once a law is settled it 's settled /.
you know you look in our history /.
we 've had a number of cases in the supreme court that have been overturned by later courts /.
and thank goodness they did /.
brown versus board of education is in my home state of kansas /.
it overruled earlier laws that said segregation was ok /.
thankfully thankfully the court overturned those prior decisions /.
chuck schumer do you expect a battle /?
well honestly let me just say i would have hoped that we could have avoided a battle /.
do you honestly expect it /?
i would have hoped that the president would choose a real consensus nominee who would have much broader support /.
but i think what happened here is not a single senator for instance said that uh harriet myers ' nomination should be withdrawn /.
sam may have been on the edge /.
but i do n't think he ever said it /.
it was only these very extreme groups that said it /.
and the president went along with them /.
and you know i got to tell you this larry /.
i ca n't tell you what will happen with judge alito /.
i think it 's very close as david gergen said /.
but any president who seeks to govern whether it 's court appointments or anything else from the extremes democrats from the far left extreme republicans from the far right extreme it does n't serve the country well /.
and it ends up not serving themselves well /.
david gergen you have a prediction /.
or too early to tell /?
too early to tell /.
watch what some of the more moderate democrats do /.
watch what olympia snow susan colins and lincoln chaffey do on the republican side /.
those are going to be the swing votes /.
and it 's just way too early to tell /.
i think it 's uh i think i think he 's reliably conservative /.
i think the issue becomes as the country gets to know what some of the individual decisions are whether the country is going to welcome this or not /.
i think it 's just too early to tell /.
i think it 's going to be a fight for both sides /.
thank you senators brownback and schumer and david gergen /.
tomorrow night ambassador joseph wilson /.
former president jimmy carter on wednesday /.
and senator john mccaine on thursday /.
and mike wallace is next /.
do n't go away /.
it 's always a great pleasure to welcome him /.
he 's with us on our on my birthday /.
he shared a lot of my life /.
and i love him /.
and he 's my favorite personality of all time /.
he 's mike wallace /.
corresponding too /-
oh larry larry larry /.
yeah you are /.
for cbs news sixty minutes since its premiere in nineteen sixty eight /.
he was there from the get - go /.
he 's earned numerous awards including three duponts and three peabodies /.
and he 's got a terrific new memoir out including a dvd from clips from some of his most favorite interviews /.
the book is between you and me /.
there you see its cover /.
a terrific read /.
before we get to the book a couple comments on matters of note /.
mike what 's your read on samuel alito /?
you had two very articulate guests on just ahead of me /.
i do n't know much about the man /.
do you /?
nope /.
he looks like an amiable fellow /.
but really i just do n't know /.
and i gather that he does not like to be called scalito as in scalia /.
for whatever reason i do n't know /.
you do know by the way that his mother apparently said on the subject of roe and wade and so forth that his mother said oh no he 's he 's he 's definitely against abortion /.
hmm /.
he 's a nice catholic boy /.
and he does n't believe in abortions /.
now what 's your read on the libby indictment /?
well that 's sad /.
it 's sad /.
and and what it does is it brings the vice president into play /.
you know something /?
there 's been very little talk lately about uh about dick cheney /.
the the uh he 's kept his own counsel /.
he 's been very quiet about it /.
who knows what he told scooter libby /.
the uh and i believe i saw it today on cnn that there is a great group of anti dick cheney people now that has grown in this country and that they do n't like the fact that he 's so unaccountable /.
you do n't see him on the air /.
he does n't answer questions /.
he um who knows /?
anyway what do you make of news people being involved /?
tim russet may testify /.
june miller goes to jail /.
well look /.
you know something /?
we are we get more and more deeply involved in the things that we cover /.
we have a tendency to do it /.
you do it /.
people talk to you off the record /.
you have confidential sources all the time all kinds of people who talk to you /.
so uh have you been subpoenaed /?
no /.
have you ever been subpoenaed in a case like similar case where someone said something to you that you may have reported or not reported /?
yes and we tried like the dickens to stay away from it /.
pardon me /.
on the westmoreland case when we were on trial for libel in the amount of a hundred and twenty million dollars and uh we had done we had done an hour and a half show about called /-
what the dickens you know something /.
this head is getting a little bit older /.
do you have trouble with your memory /?
yes !
you do /?
the older we get the harder it is /.
it is /.
it 's a fact /.
how about your hearing /?
harder but not not as hard as memory though /.
how about memory is tough /.
and your glasses your eyes /?
they 're they 're not terribly worse /.
but i 've worn glasses /-
see mike /.
you 're the guest ok /?
alright /.
so you went to court over westmorland /.
in fact you told us in the past that added to your depression /.
yeah that 's true /.
that 's that 's uh that 's what started the depression for the first time /.
i did n't realize what was happening /.
but to sit in a cold and drafty federal court room being called thief liar cheat etc by the /-
because of the uh plaintiff had first crack at me /.
and to sit there and listen to that kind of thing /.
believe me /.
all of the sudden i could n't sleep /.
i began to believe that maybe i was guilty /.
ha it really was funny /.
alright tell me about this unusual book a collection of memories and interviews a great memoir that also has a dvd /.
give me the history of the book /.
well first of all had you read it /-
because i mean level with me /.
i told you /.
i told you off the air i 've read it /.
i did n't hear the dvd yet though /.
you did n't hear the dvd /?
no /.
you know something /?
first of all did you like the book /?
i said i love the book /.
it 's more than interesting /.
find it interesting /?
really /?
well look at your career /.
look at the people you 've talked to /.
how could it not be interesting /?
the wonderful thing really is the wonderful is that that uh over the years /-
can you imagine back in nineteen fifty - seven being able to talk to eleanor roosevelt /?
and do you remember a man by the name of of um here we go westbrooke peggler /?
ah used to read him and hate him all the time /.
read him and hated him /.
that 's correct /.
well i quoted to her in this interview back in nineteen hundred and fifty seven i was on abc at the time /.
and what he had said about her /.
and what a vicious unpleasant lying etc etc etc /.
and she she enjoyed it so much /.
talk about a soft answer turning away red /.
i wish you i hope you have that maybe available there , that you have n't seen it /.
no i have n't seen it /.
i 've read it of course /.
yeah i know /.
but but if uh i do n't know if you 're going to be able to play any of these things or not /.
then there was there was um /-
what what i used to do larry was occasionally make speeches as you know cause you 're making them all the time /.
and there there you show up /.
and you want to do a new speech something new give the audience something to chew on /.
but that gets to be a pain in the neck after a while /.
so /.
and it 's a very lucrative way to get from here to there /.
in any case what i used to do was set up a big screen in the hall /.
and then i would lead into something from uh you know the people that i had had before /.
great idea /.
and maybe do five different people in the course of an hour questions and so forth /.
well the people at um it was it really was good /.
the people at the uh publisher heard about it saw it and said hey somebody 's got a hell of a book /.
boy were they right /.
let me get a break /.
we 'll come right back /.
as we go to break the book is between you and me /.
and here are some clips from the dvd /.
watch /.
she has become a she 's a great mutual friend /.
and she 's a terrific lady /.
that was tough though , was n't it /?
that was tough /.
and you were the guy who straightened it out for me /.
in fact we 'll show the audience how we did that /.
watch how we straightened it out /.
and i called her the next morning /.
and we patched the whole thing up /.
i know /.
well we both adore her /.
we both adore her very well and admire her immensely /.
she 's such a special lady /.
why did n't we read her well years ago /?
how do you mean /?
i mean in the office /.
she had that that fire lady kind of image in washington /.
oh well she was she was he listened to her /.
her husband listened to her /.
and she got involved in politics more than we know /.
and when she wanted to get rid of donald reegan /.
remember when they used to live in that little branch house /?
yeah /.
i got to tell you /-
have you talked to her lately /?
uh a month ago was the last time /.
i hope i 'll call her tomorrow and we 'll have dinner /.
the give her my love /.
the uh the fact of the matter is that she 's uh she had she 's been having some trouble with her back /.
yeah i know /.
and she fell /.
and yeah she fell and and /-
well she 's an adorable woman /.
in any case /-
oh are we going to hear this now /?
no you 're not scaring me though there 's something you know we do n't know mike /?
what are you talking about /?
i mean about nancy /.
like you seem troubled /.
well no not troubled /.
look /.
she 's not a child anymore /.
and you i know feel the same way about her /.
she 's one of my favorite people on the planet /.
i know it /.
i know /.
mhm /.
now let 's get a break and come back with more /.
we 'll take calls too for mike wallace /.
the book is between you and me with the dvd /.
and that rhymes /.
and we 'll be right back /.
great moment in the book /.
that 's clint hill the secret service man when the kennedy assassination /-
what was that like for you /?
oh look /.
the anguish in that man 's heart /.
he believed if we could see a little bit more of that i 'd be grateful /.
the the he believed that he was responsible for jfk dying /.
and i forget exactly how we got to talk to him /.
i believe it was seventy - five /.
yeah it was /.
and he and all of the sudden he began to /-
i mean listen to some of this /.
we do n't have more of it /.
but it 's a /-
and that /-
how much of it 's on the on the dvd /?
the whole it 's it 's about three minutes long larry /.
the the uh he really believed that he was responsible /.
and and just he had a nervous breakdown and so forth /.
mmm /.
had it on the air /.
huh /?
looks like he had it on the air /.
that 's correct /.
he was he was feeling that way /.
the book by the way is between you and me /.
the dvd comes with it /.
incredible with this incredible career that you have never interviewed george w. bush /.
that 's corre- i 've never met him /.
how come /?
never met him /?
karl rove told me when he was governor of texas i went down there to do a piece on um tort reform /.
and rove made up his mind that that uh we were on the wrong side of that issue /.
and he said mr. wallace i did n't know him then he said mr. wallace you 're not going to talk to the governor /.
we know that your mind is made up /.
so we 're not going to let you talk to him /.
ok so we did the piece anyway /.
uh what happened then was when he came to the white house i figured well come on /.
the time has come /.
i mean i 've talked to every president since abe lincoln so and every first lady since martha washington /.
uh reminds me from time to time /.
but seriously uh he just said forget it /.
you 're not going to talk to him /.
and i have never met forget talked to george w. bush /.
did rove give you a reason /?
after /.
forget the tort reform and governor /.
did he give you a reason when he was president why you could n't interview him /?
karl rove does n't like me ha which of course makes /-
because /?
who the dickens knows /?
who knows /?
i have no idea why /.
well you know that this is the tightest white house going as far as as uh really talking candidly is concerned and uh and the most secretive if you will /.
both the president and the vice president they do n't like the press /.
and they particularly do n't like people who might ask uh interesting questions or abrasive questions or whatever /.
people do n't know this /.
but we did this in interview a long time ago in miami /.
you were offered the job of press secretary by richard nixon /.
indeed i was /.
and you know something /?
richard nixon i was offered the job as press secretary to richard nixon /.
and we got along like a /.
and i 'll tell you (sbar-nom-prd-tpc-3 (whnp-2 (wp who i really got along with was patricia nixon /.
really /?
she was a oh she was a lovely woman /.
and we i travelled with him because he was a thought to be a loser so he was happy to you know have me come along with him and the kids julie and tricia and pat nixon /.
and uh she was a obviously a bruised woman because of the way that that whole watergate thing was coming down /.
and um that 's one person i really really wanted to do an interview with /.
but she was scared /.
she would n't she would n't do it /.
probably the least known first lady /.
that 's correct /.
and a lovely lovely woman /.
you know they called her it was gloria steinam i believe that called her plastic pat /.
yeah /.
the least plastic individual that i 've ever met /.
we 're going to go to calls going to go to calls for mike wallace and take a break /.
and uh when we come back the book is between you and me /.
and is mr. wallace with mr. nixon /.
what a life /.
wallace wallace wallace mike wallace /.
the book is between you and me with a dvd accompanying it /.
terrific read /.
toronto canada /.
we got to some calls /.
hello /.
hi there mike /?
yeah /.
uh first of all i just wanted to say that i uh i pretty much uh when i first came to canada here i got my political education watching those cbs broadcasts /.
ah /.
with uh walter cronkite and charles uh kerald and eric severide /.
um it was a great broadcast /.
course /.
i got to tell you when i when i um joined that group cronkite severide kerald and so forth that 's like that was like being admitted to the mother church /.
ha ha /.
what 's the question sir /?
ok actually i had this question before you started uh talking about uh karl rove /.
uh you had mentioned uh that you find it rather uh odd i guess the silence of dick cheney or maybe not so odd but he has been silent /.
but i find it uh not only bizarre but uh just unfathomable how george bush has been silent about karl rove /.
he does n't talk about him much , does he mike /?
he does n't talk about him at all /.
does n't get asked about him /.
he simply you know we know that it was rove who helped to make him a governor and who helped to make him president /.
and uh would n't it be wonderful to find out more about what rove had to do with all of the stuff that we 've been reading about /?
well we know he had something to do /.
he 's named in the indictment /.
but he 's not indicted /.
and not that 's correct /.
yeah /.
bakersfield california hello /.
hello between you and me you gentlemen continue to make a major contribution to the citizens of this country /.
so i 'd like the two brains that i see in front of me to answer this question to which i 've been unable to find an answer /.
if we truly even for a moment believed that there were weapons of mass destruction why did we send in ground forces /?
thank you /.
you mean rather than what /?
what if we believe there were weapons of mass destruction why would we sound in send in ground forces /?
oh i see /.
why would we put them at peril /?
you know something /?
that that 's uh listen that 's a good question /.
very good huh uh /.
and what they did was as as you remember /-
and i i was astonished when i saw that that they /-
you remember shock and awe /?
yeah /.
the united states attacking iraq and telling the world that we were going to shock and awe the world with the attack that we were going to make on /-
i mean it 's and it was george tennet was it not who said it 's a slam dunk /.
yep /.
that there were weapons of mass destruction there /.
that 's a good question did we put our boys male and girls and women at peril /.
mhm /.
hello hello jay georgia hello /.
ah thank you larry /.
and mike i loved your book /.
it was great /.
and toward the end of the book you said secretary putin of russia had asked you to come over and interview him /.
had you done that /?
uh and i 'd like to know about it /.
thank you so much /.
yeah /.
i did interview putin yes /.
on the sixtieth on the sixtieth anniversary of the uh end of world war two he asked me to come on over and interview him /.
and it was carried uh in a lot of places /.
but i tell you something /.
putin to my way of thinking who calls himself a democrat /-
he 's not our kind of democrat /.
but i have admiration for him /.
i think he 's an honorable man /.
i think well he 's done a very good job for russia /.
and he 's said he is not gon- he 'll be fifty five he 'll be fifty five at the end of his second term /.
and he said he 's not going to run for another term because it would be destabilizing not going to ask to change the constitution /.
i asked him almost as a joke uh why do n't you uh i tell you what why do n't you go into journalism /?
money is good /.
age does n't make a heck of a lot of difference ha ha /.
he looked at me like i was crazy /.
but who knows /.
did n't you find him as i found him easy to be around /?
putin /?
yeah /.
oh absolutely /.
very good idiomatic english /.
he spoke on camera in in russian /.
but but uh i admire the man /.
me too /.
we 'll take a break and be back with more of mike wallace /.

fine /.
mr. wallace this is a big pleasure for me to talk to you /.
but um i had uh what is your most difficult interview that you had in sixty minutes the most difficult person that you could have ever interviewed /?
i i think probably the aiatola really because he was not anxious to do it /.
it was um just after the hostages the us hostages had been taken in iran /.
and i was surprised that he was willing to talk to talk to us /.
and it was a very very difficult business /.
we did it in the holy city of which uh we /-
and and the circumstances were were difficult /.
they took good care to see that we did n't get into trouble /.

journalists sources and jail /.
a conversation with bob woodward about the cia leak investigation judith miller karl rove his long and tortured relationship with deep throat and trying to crack the secrecy surrounding the supreme court /.
welcome back to this one hour edition of reliable sources /.
with judith miller in jail and washington in an uproar over journalists protecting karl rove and other high level administration sources in the valerie plame leak investigation who better to check in with than bob woodward the author most recently of the secret man a new book about his relationship with the famous watergate source deep throat /.
(advp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (rb here 's my conversation with the washington post assistant managing editor /.
judith miller in jail for protecting her sources an act of conscience ah paying a heavy price /.
but is n't there a minimal public sympathy for her because these sources were not exposing wrongdoing as deep throat did but outing a cia operative /?
um yes ah apparently /.
ah again i 'm not sure there 's any crime in all of this /.
um the special prosecutor 's been working eighteen months /.
uh eighteen months into watergate we knew about the tapes /.
people were in jail /.
people had pled guilty /.
in other words there was a solid evidentary trail /.
well but crime or not crime or not it looks like a bit of political dirty work /.
i do n't see it here /.
well n- i mean it it it may just be politics as usual /.
w- i i mean rove 's ah defenders say look , the evidence is /-
and the ev- and and the evidence is ah that he was saying ah um joe wilson who was uh criticizing the administration on weapons of mass destruction really had an axe to grind and got his job because his wife had worked at the cia and recommended him /.
so th- there 's fuzziness to this /.
now it may turn out to be ah worse than watergate /.
ah but ah it does n't look that way now /.
all right i asked the new york times editor bill keller ah this past week about whether the newspaper and judy miller were acting above the law after losing in the courts /.
here 's what he had to say /.
th- the above the law thing is is a little gratuitous ah i think /.
ah i mean the law presented judy miller with a choice she could betray her trust ah or she could go to jail /.
and she took what i believe is the the brave and honorable choice /.
she went to jail /.
we r- we ran out of law /.
could you have been subpeonaed ah and threatened with jail during watergate /.
or was the climate toward the press so much different then /?
well i do n't know that it 's different /.
ah assuredly we could 've carl berstein and i could 've been subpoenaed ah /.
did you worry about it /?
sure a little bit /.
but you know what what happened ah /.
there were so many specifics in our stories ah about money and and high level people in the white house and the nixon campaign that the prosecutors could subpoena them and get them to talk which eventually they did /.
and there were senate hearings when ah everyone testified in public /.
so you you had ah very very different circumstances /.
so you know i agree with the editor of the new york times that ah this is a not a perfect case judy miller /.
but the idea of the government and special prosecutors monkeying around with the relationship that reporters have with sources ah is a is a very very bad thing /.
and you look at the matt cooper business /.
and you know not to ah spend a lot of time on the details /.
pull a camera back /.
what 's going on here /.
but you know better than anyone there is an informal network of reporters and government people on both sides democrats republicans ah liberals conservatives who talk to reporters /.
and i- y- i may talk to somebody /.
and we will talk about ninety or a hundred subjects /.
what 's going on /.
what do you hear /.
what does this look like /.
where is that going /.
and then something comes up like this where suddenly you 're dealing with a covert operative /.
what do n't we know /.
maybe you did n't expect the person to say that /.
but you 've given your word , you 've given your pledge , you 're going to protect this person /.
yes but but but i do n't think peo- when we learn all about this um i think very few people knew she was a covert operative in the cia , that she worked in the cia as a w weapons of mass destruction analyst /.
so this is the kind of banter that goes on that helps the public and us figure out uh what the stories are , what 's being hidden ah what games are being played and so forth /.
in other words do n't underestimate the importance of these background or off the record conversations /.
/.
e- exactly it it sounds kind of like a a bs session /.
a and some of it is /.
but it 's a vital lifeline to the underbelly of government /.
for the special prosecutor to come roaring in here with a tank and say ah you know i 'm going to destroy that and ah here look at judy miller , she never wrote a story about this this is totally ridiculous /.
right you you mentioned you mentioned karl rove /.
newsweek reports that he discussed plame /.
and we have the email now ah with matt cooper /.
new york times reports that karl rove discussed plame with carl novak /.
um does any of this reporting make you uncomfortable given all the books and articles written about who deep throat was that reporters are now going up to other reporters ' sources on this story /?
yeah sure and i i think the i think the prosecutor 's making a mistake /.
and i think the judge in the case should 've been much more rigorous in making the government really show they have evidence of a crime and they need this testimony /.
all these discussions now it may turn out in the end to be very different /.
but all the discussions that rove had with these two reporters bob novak and matt cooper that we know about and there may have been others were not about valerie plame as a covert undercover cia operative whose identity had to be protected like the crown jewels /.
right /.
it was about somebody in the cia who was an analyst who got her husband this job to go to africa to see if they could find evidence of wh- /-
but her husband being a prominent white house critic who clearly the administration was angry at and wanted to /.
yeah sure but but you know welcome you know ah welcome to ah washington and politics /.
you 're saying it 's hardball /.
all right a- /-
a- now i- the question is i mean /.
i 'm sorry /.
i wo n't answer it /.
you you ah /-
does this go beyond the boundaries of the normal interchange of information /?
based on what i 've seen does n't /.
i- and and they 're cutting into it /.
and i think it 's a a mistake /.
i wanted to ask you about scott mcclellan who as you know has been just uh eviscerated by reporters at the white house this week /.
let 's loo- take a look at monday 's breifing and some of the questions about rove /.
scott i mean just i mean this is ridiculous the notion that you 're going to stand before us after having commented with that level of detail and tell people watching this that somehow you 've decided not to talk /.
now that rove has in a sense been caught red - handed peddling this information all of a sudden you have respect for the sanctity of a criminal investigation /?
does mcclellan 's role here remind you at all of the old nixon spokesman ron zeigler calling watergate a third - rate burglary and stonewalling to use a watergate term /?
is the administration stonewalling here /?
well /.
scott mcclellan is stonewalling and saying i 'm not going to answer /.
but he 's not denying things /.
he earlier he earlier said totally ridiculous /.
he earlier was doing /-
yeah but th- was involved involved in what /?
involved in criminal disclosure of this ah woman 's identity or involved in this free interchange ah /.
now i admit we you know noone knows the answer to this /.
i do n't even think the special prosecutor knows the answer to this /.
so ah let 's wait and see /.
but th- but (advp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (rb here 's the lesson /.
be careful what you say ah particularly early in an inquiry /.
and what 's the main lesson of watergate /.
in these sort of uh scandals you know better than anyone /.
get the full story out completely at the start so they do n't have to drag it out of you /.
and that 's what we 're in /.
we 're in the dragging out phase /.
all right turning now to the secret man and your relationship with deep throat mark felt then the number two official in the fbi you grapple with the question of why did he do it , why did he risk his career to meet you in that parking garage /.
you 're still not sure /.
no i am /.
i lay out the reasons /.
but i- it 's layered tha- you know like most human motivation /.
um there 're many um reasons /.
and they 're they 're uh occurring simultaneously /.
but what outraged /-
and you say y- y- you say you in in your question you you have an assumption /.
did he risk his career /.
you see ah /-
was n't it dangerous /?
it was dangerous /.
but we set up the- these clandestine meetings ah and clandestine signals so he did n't have to risk his career /.
i was pledged to tell noone /.
he set up this system so noone would know that we were talking /.
and so as far as he was concerned yes there 's always risk in something like this /.
but he had taken such extreme care that there was minimal risk /.
let 's take a look at how most people think of who most people think of when they think of deep throat /.
they think of hal holbrook and the movie all the president 's men /.
let 's watch /.
the story has stalled on us /.
and you thought i 'd help /?
i 'll never quote you /.
i would n't quote you even as an anonymous source /.
you 'd be on deep background /.
but of course in your book with carl bernstein and the movie you do describe a deep throat character /.
did you have any reservations about that /.
were you betraying that agreement we just saw /?
ah no i really was n't because he also said that (pp-loc-tpc-1 (in in the agreement was no disclosure but ah like all complicated relationships he said push me /.
i 've been a street agent in the fbi /.
and you do n't get anywhere unless you push people like hale /.
so go ahead /.
so there are two tracks absolute confidentiality but push as much to get as much information , confirm as much new information as possible /.
and ah when we wrote the book ah all the president 's men carl and i thought i mean how do you leave deep throat out /?
ah would 've been dishonest /.
ah we concealed his identity in a way ah that it remained confidential for more than thirty years after that book came out and it only was disclosed because mark felt his lawyer and family decided to disclose it /.
how did you feel when more recently you saw that fbi memo that he had signed saying that woodward and berstein were reporting half - truths and fiction and we need to find the leakers this at the very time when he was meeting privately and secretly with you kind of duplicitous /.
yes o- i- it 's very d- duplicitous yes /.
but it 's also very careful because th- it was addressing a specific story that he was not a source of /.
and in the memo he says yes clearly ah they have access to fbi or justice department sources /.
and then in the process of this leak investigation which he is running he finds the leakers somebody in the white house and presumably one of the assistant prosecutors he alleges /.
so it 's perfect /.
ah and he sends this memo to the acting fbi director al patrick grey /.
and then they send it a message to the attorney general ah saying you know case closed we found out who did it /.
it 's perfect /.
counter-intelligence i- it 's very sophisticated /.
it 's what somebody would do who was a soviet spy or a spy in the kremlin for us /.
right /.
now in nineteen seventy eight felt was convicted later pardoned ah of authorizing black - bag jobs against weathermen underground radicals /.
um did that change your view of him /?
i mean here supposedly he 'd been outraged by nixon white house corruption in in dealing with you /.
and yet he engaged in some of it himself /.
yes th- that 's right /.
and his justification was that there was a security threat /.
but there 's always a security threat /.
um but it it is different because what nixon was doing was for political purposes political intelligence um /.
the weathermen were violent /.
there 's no question about it /.
i do n't think they posed a threat to the republic that clearly at this moment mark felt and some other people in the fbi thought /.
you write ah here bob woodward that the portrait of me is not all that admirable /.
and you say that you lied to richard cohen the washington post columnist and your colleague ah who wanted to write a column this was twenty years ago about saying that he thought felt was deep throat /.
why why did n't you just say i 'm not going to talk about it as you did when most journalists asked /?
be- because he had the initials on the memo which were mf mark felt and he knew carl berstein 's wife and he was going to assert it with the kind of authority that is rare not rare for richard as a columnist but uh that this was a fact /.
and this was a sensitive time /.
this was when felt was on trial /.
this was ah either before or right after , he had been pardoned by ronald reagan /.
i had to protect the source /.
and cohen was persistant /.
i could n't stop him without lying /.
i lied /.
i i regret doing that /.
and i 've apologized to him since /.
and he said well of course you lied /.
you have to protect the source /.
ah it was just one column /.
all right we need to take a break /.
when we come back , was mark felt capable of informed consent in releasing his long held secret to the world /?
we 'll ask bob woodward that question next /.
cnn tonight at seven /.
after terrorist target london how 's the rest of the world winning the war on terror /?
then at eight an all new progress report on the war on terror /.
go beyond the headlines starting with cnn tonight seven eastern /.
welcome back to reliable sources /.
we 're talking to bob woodward about his new book on deep throat /.
for years you were tempted to call mark felt and to renew and perhaps repair your relationship with him /.
you say you were gutless and you did n't do it /.
why /?
yeah i i i was gutless um because h- you know he had gone through this trial , it looked like ten years in jail ah he was devastated and ah /-
and he 'd been cold toward you /.
yeah yeah he was not happy with the book and the movie ah /.
but but the main thing is this was a guy ah whose liberty was in jeopardy for about three or four years /.
he was pardoned by reagan /.
and i felt he dodged a bullet /.
ah his wife was ill /.
ah she died i think in nineteen eighty four /.
and and then he went out to live with his daughter /.
and i felt look ah his life is fine /.
he 's happy /.
i 've got other things to do /.
ah i know what happened /.
he kn- he knows ah what happened /.
i what 's the loop to close /.
and then ah very belatedly five years ago i went to see him /.
and his memory is gone /.
/.
but there is still that wonderful kind of human connection that 's almost ah primal /.
ah he recognized who i was /.
yeah yeah very emotional /.
/. but but but when you talk about his memory he did n't even remember this was five years ago or even or barely remembered that richard nixon had resigned /.
looms large in all of our memories /.
so was it surprising shocking disappointing frustrating that he remembered so little /?
let me r- /-
yes that 's right /.
sad sad sad /.
yeah /.
and my regret is i did n't get out there sooner and sit down with him and say look we need to talk about this /.
what more is there to it /.
how how did the signals work /.
ah what are some of the things you were thinking /.
same time i know a lot about hi- his motive of frustration and uh you know reckless uh law - breaking going on in the nixon white house uh the level of lawbreaking which we have not seen since and i hope we never see again /.
it 's i mean he saw it /.
and he wa- he was willing to help /. but he was willing to help in a way /.
he did n't look at himself as a leaker /.
i think in a sense ah he did n't look at himself as the deep throat who was kind of this this person who came forward /.
the swashbuckling source /.
he was guiding you /.
but he was also would n't volunteer information /.
yeah h- he was careful /.
he was careful /.
and that this was you know he this was a j edgar hoover man /.
and i think we may find out someday ah i i hope we do that he studied at the feet of the master hoover who who did things like this a lot /.
/.
but was he capable now at the age of ninety one of giving informed consent to go public /.
a- or did you decide you were just not going to push him even if it meant that vanity fair or somebody else got that story first /?
well i ah consulted ben bradley the former editor of the post /.
and he said you really ca n't get informed consent /.
i c- ah consulted the best lawyer in town bob barnett /.
ah and he went through it and said you need voluntary absolute and ah competent ah declaration on his part that you were ah released from this agreement /.
and there was no way to get it ah given mark felt 's state of mind /.
so i backed off /.
all right bob woodward /.
stay put /.
when we come back did n't everyone in the press say that william rehnquist was about to retire as cheif justice /?
we 'll ask woodward about that in a moment /.
welcome back to our conversation with bob woodward /.
speculation about the cheif justice of the united states got out of control this past week /.
many believe it 's just a matter of time before chief justice william rehnquist steps down /.
my source tells me that he is going to retire and the time of retiring is going to be as soon as the president is back in the country as soon as air force one lands in the country /.
what everyone believes and i guess i do agree with this is that the cheif justice will now step down this week , that there will be two vacancies /.
rehnquist of course now saying he has no plans to ah step down /.
was n't this the press that had speculated worse /?
yeah it was /.
and ah kind of stupidly so /.
ah i mean th- there is a way to say look he 's ill /.
ah people are claiming they have inside information /.
but i thought ah rehnquist said it best when somebody asked him recently and said it 's for me to know and you to find out /.
i remember hearing that phrase first in third grade /.
now you wrote a book about the supreme court the brethren /.
at the time rehnquist was on the supreme court /.
five justices cooperated with you you 've said /.
rehnquist was one of them /?
i 'm not saying /.
we do n't disclose our sources /.
so there 's still deep throats on the court /?
that 's right /.
and you know we still protect sources who ah were justices or are justices perhaps /.
but you have lewis powell was one of your sources because he 's passed away /.
yes yes he he he 's deceased /.
and it 's very interesting having a supreme court justice who 's a confidential source /.
ah someday when my notes on this are released you will see supreme court justices saying come in the back door /.
ah ah do n't quote a justice because somebody will say which son of a bitch talked /.
/. why do n't justices talk on the record /?
i mean there is it 's this kind of secretive shadowy institution /.
um should they give more interviews to people like you /?
oh of course ye- oh yes /.
i think we need more sunlight on all institutions /.
and that 's why scott armstrong and i did the book ah on the supreme court /.
ah people now realize that lots of the justices ' papers are avaliable how incredibly accurate and carefully that book was done /.
all right well i love the idea of justices spinning you on background at least trying to get their version of the truth out /.
ah just breifly ah mark felt ah we were talking about he 's made his own book and movie deal /.
ah can you see tom hanks playing deep throat in the next movie /?
um anything 's possible /.
maybe he 'll be playing karl rove in the next movie /.
who knows ah /.
funny things happen /. but i think ah felt 's lawyer and family can do ah something that 's going to add to the record on all of this /.
all right we 'll wait and see /.
bob woodward thanks for joining us /.
thank you /.
we 'll be right back /.
from nbc news in washington this is meet the press with jim russert /.
our issues this sunday the war in iraq tensions with iran and the future of this woman our guest the secretary of state condoleezza rice /.
then will there be a white house staff shake - up /?
and what is at stake in the two thousand six midterm elections /?
insight and analysis from david broder of the washington post elisabeth bumiller white house correspondent for the new york times charlie cook of the national journal and john harwood of the wall street journal and cnbc /.
but first as we begin the fourth year of the war in iraq we are joined by the secretary of state /.
welcome back madame secretary /.
good morning /.
nice to be with you tim /.
very disturbing headlines in the papers yesterday the russians helping iraq /.
and this is how it was captured in the paper /.
russian officials collected intelligence on us troop movements and attack plans from inside the american military command leading the two thousand and three invasion of iraq and passed that information on to iraqi leader saddam hussein according to a us military study /.
the intelligence report which the study said were provided to hussein through the russian ambassador in baghdad during the height of the us assault warned accurately that american formations intended to bypass iraqi cities on their thrust towards baghdad /.
the reports provided some specific numbers on us troop units ' locations according to iraqi documents dated march and april oh three and later captured by the united states /.
have you told the russians what is going on /?
well we 're trying first to m- make sure we understand fully what the documents say /.
uh these are documents that were found uh in iraqi stores /.
and obviously tim we would take very seriously uh any suggestion that uh this may have been done uh maybe to the detriment of american forces /.
and so uh we will certainly raise it with the russian government /.
we want to uh take a real hard look at the documents and then raise it with the russian government /.
but these are us documents a us report /.
y- yes /.
you believe the report /.
oh i i certainly think there is uh a lot to this report /.
but we really have n't a cha- had a chance to look at the documents in uh detail /.
intend to do that and then to raise it with the russian government /.
i would hope the russian government will take it seriously /.
will there be an investigation as to who leaked the information to the russians /?
well i we 'll just have to see /.
i d- i do n't want to get ahead of us /.
but obviously we take very seriously uh any suggestion that uh this may have been done at the beginning of the war /.
that would be a quite serious charge /.
was it could it have been deliberate misinformation /?
i do n't know /.
i think we really have to take a look at the documents /.
we 're finding thousands and thousands and thousands of documents /.
and uh we 're going to find some uh i- i- some important and uh surprising things in these documents /.
i think we have to step back take a hard look at the documents /.
but i definitely we will raise it with the russian government /.
when we first went into iraq we had some unexpected encounters with fedayeen /.
and we lost uh dozens of american men that russians may have been responsible for american deaths /.
well i do n't want to try hypothetically to to know what impact this might have had /.
i think the first thing we need to do is take a good hard look at the documents /.
and then we definitely want to raise it with the russian government /.
and again i would hope that the russian government would uh would take it seriously and and give us a serious answer on what they find /.
back in june of two thousand one the president said he looked vladimir putin in the eye /.
he got a sense of his soul found him to be very straightforward and very trustworthy /.
does the president still believe that president putin is straightforward and trustworthy /?
i really do think that the russians have generally done what they said they would do /.
they said they were going to oppose the iraq war and they did /.
and they told us that from the very beginning /.
uh so i do n't have an argument there /.
and i do n't want to jump to the conclusion that this was something that was ordered out of the kremlin /.
we have to look at the documents /.
we have to go to the russian government /.
but i would hope that the russian government would take seriously uh any suggestion uh that they may have passed uh data to the iraqis uh at the advent of the war /.
but the russian ambassador is the source /.
how could putin not have known /.
and how could it be straightforward and honest for the russians to help saddam hussein /?
tim we have to get to the bottom of the facts of this /.
we will most certainly raise it with the russian government /.
i i 've said several times it 's a serious matter /.
but uh i do n't want to jump out ahead and start making accusations about what uh the russians may or may not have known /.
this is something in a relationship that we have with the russians that really is candid and where we do talk about difficult things all the time , where i think we 'll be able to talk about this and talk about it uh honestly /.
why wo n't the russians help us get sanctions in the united nations against iran and try to stop them from developing nuclear weapons /?
well we 're not yet at the stage where we 're seeking sanctions /.
uh what we 're doing now is uh we 're seeking a presidential statement that would make clear to iran the international community 's determination that it live up to the obligations that everyone thinks iran has /.
we 're working through it /.
uh we have a s- the same strategy here /.
we have the same uh view of the problem /.
the russians do not want a nuclear rec- weapon in iran either /.
it 's been very clear in everything that they have tried to do in the way that they set up the civil nuclear cooporation with bushehr in what they offered the iranians that the russians also do not believe that there should be enrichment and reprocessing capability on iranian soil /.
and uh enrichment and reprocessing capability is the core here /.
if you 're able to enrich and reprocess then the ability to build a bomb is is there /.
and so we and the russians uh the chinese and certainly the europeans have the same view of what is what is to be prevented /.
uh yes we 've had some tactical differences on how to get there /.
but uh i talked with my russian counterpart uh on friday /.
we agreed that our people would go back and work very hard this weekend and we 'll see where we are on monday /.
um we 're considering whether it might be a good idea to get um after we have a presidential statement uh get ministers together again uh with the the p five the permanent five of the security council plus germany uh to talk about charting a course forward because everybody takes very seriously iran 's intransigence and iran 's unwillingness uh to do what the international community is bid- is uh determined that it will do /.
it is the policy of our government that iran will not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon /.
i- i- tim iran can not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon /.
that is the view of the international community not just the united states /.
this article is in the new york times /.
the reality is that most of us think the iranians are probably going to get a weapon or the technology to make one sooner or later an administration official acknowledged a few weeks ago refusing to talk on the record because such an admission amounts to a concession that dragging iran in front of the united nations security council may prove an exercise in futility /.
the optomists around here about the white house just hope we can delay the day by ten or twenty years and that by that time we 'll have a different relationship with a different iranian government /.
that seems like a much different policy /.
well i since i do n't know who this anonymous person is i ca n't tell you what uh w- what relationship they may have to the policy /.
i 'll tell you who does n't think that /.
i do n't believe uh that /.
i do n't believe that the president believes that because we 're doing everything that we can to uh send a strong signal to the iranians that they have no choice /.
if they wish to be a part of the international community they have no choice but to give up ambitions that could lead to the technologies that would lead to a nuclear weapon /.
uh if the international community stays really solid here iran can not stand the kind of isolation from the international community that for instance north korea endures almost by choice /.
we really do have a chance to solve this diplomatically /.
but tim i would be the first to say we ca n't afford to waste time /.
that 's why we need our our people in in new york to really work toward this first phase /.
we need to see if that has a an effect on the iranians /.
and if it does not have an effect on the iranians we need to move to the next phase /.
which is /?
the next phase is uh to look to uh further uh options in the security council /.
for instance perhaps the chapter seven resolution /.
which is /?
chapter seven resolution essentially gives uh the un or the security council the ability to compel a state to act /.
uh it i- can um say that there would be consequences if actions are not taken /.
including military /?
well uh no one ever takes anything off the table /.
but i believe we 're a long way from uh from that /.
we have the possibilities of financial measures that could be taken uh bans against travel /.
there are there are a lot of uh options once you 're in the security council /.
that 's why it was very important to get this uh dossier iranian dossier to the security council and why the diplomacy that we 've been working over the last uh couple of years to get the europeans and the united states on the same page and to now bring the russians and the chinese along uh has been so important /.
d- do you believe if the president chose to embark on military action with iran he would go to congress for authorization first /?
i 'm not going to speculate on that /.
the president uh v- is uh v- clear that he keeps all of his options on the table /.
but tim i think speculating about how we might uh set up military action is n't helpful at a time when we really are concentrating on the diplomacy /.
but i want to be very clear /.
but you would n't go to congress /?
well eh tim of course the uh administration went to congress uh the last time /.
and i would just uh ask people to look at the history of how this president has uh has acted /.
he has uh taken congress as a full partner in these matters /.
but i 'm not going to get into a discussion of what the president may or may not do uh constitutionally /.
let me turn back to iraq /.
the war now in its fourth year /.
and these are the grim statistics /.
us troops killed two thousand three hundred and sixteen . wounded injured seventeen thousand two hundred seventy - one /.
iraqis killed an estimate num- estimated number is thirty thousand /.
hundred and thirty thousand american troops on the ground /.
when you were planning the war some three and a half years ago did you have any idea that three years into the war those are the numbers that you would be confronting /?
well i certainly thought that it would be difficult /.
um i do n't think anyone um knew precisely what we would be facing in terms of numbers /.
and look /.
every one of those deaths is uh mourned by people in the administration uh because these are families that have lost um husbands and wives and daughters and sons /.
um but we also know that nothing of value is ever won without sacrifice /.
we 're in iraq because the um united states of america faces a different kind of enemy and a different kind of war /.
and we have to have a different kind of middle east if we 're ever going to resolve the uh the the problems of an ideology of hatred that was so great that people flew airplanes into buildings /.
iraq was a saddam hussein 's iraq was a threat /.
now that the /-
b- but but saddam was not related to flying airplanes into buildings /.
no /.
and we have never said that saddam /-
u- uh saddam was not related to the events of september eleventh /.
but if you really believe that the only thing that happened on september eleventh was people flew airplanes into buildings i think you have a very narrow view of what we faced on september eleventh /.
we faced the um the outcome of an ideology of hatred throughout the middle east that had to be dealt with /.
saddam hussein was a part of that old middle east /.
the new iraq will be a part of a new middle east /.
and we will all be safer /.
but madame secretary weapons of mass destruction was the primary rationale given to go into iraq /.
lisa myers of nbc news broke a story last week that the iraqi foreign minister mister sabri w- became a spy for the french and and the cia /.
and this is how it was reported /.
saddam hussein 's last foreign minister naji sabri paid spy for +french intelligence later turned him over to the cia to supply information about iraq its chemical biological nuclear weapon program more than six months before the war began in march of oh three according {to} former intelligence officials /.
the sources said he provided information {the?} iraqi dictator had ambitions for a nuclear program but it was not active and that no biological weapons were being produced or stockpiled although research was under way /.
that 's a far cry from what the american people were told /.
of course tim this was a single source among multiple sources /.
and the problem was that saddam hussein was unwilling after multiple revel- resolutions in the security council to account for his uh weapons programs /.
uh we all remember that the accounting of the un mission that was suppo- uh weapons inspection mission that was supposed to uh look into its weapons program could not account for large stockpiles /.
we all thought that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction /.
he certainly had a a very healthy appetite for them /.
and he had used them before both against his own people and against his neighbors /.
he was a threat /.
this was someone flying uh against our aircraft or or i- shooting at our aircraft as they flew the no - fly zone /.
he 'd invaded his neighbors /.
but the point is that now that he 's gone iraq has an opportunity to be a different iraq in a different kind of middle east /.
i know it 's hard /.
and i know that the numbers that you 've put up are difficult to see /.
and i know that the violence on tv is difficult /.
but i would ask people to uh to look at the perspective here of what is really going on in iraq /.
under this uh the violence under the specter of this violence you have iraqis now sunni shia kurds and others determined to form a government of national unity /.
that 's extraordinary in iraq 's history where they 've always settled their differences by violence not by politics /.
and when they succeed in that you uh they are going to have the basis for a very uh different kind of iraq /.
and i think they 're going to succeed /.
but people are being asked to take your judgement on this as we sit here this morning and refer to previous judgements the administration made /.
weapons of mass destruction there were none /.
we would be greeted as liberators /.
this is three years later /.
that th- it would not take hundreds of thousands of american troops to occupy iraq /.
tommy franks according to the book cobra two said we 'd be down to thirty thousand troops in november of oh three /.
the cost of the war the budget director of the white house said it 'd be fifty billion dollars /.
it 's now over three hundred and fifty billion dollars /.
each judgement has proven to be wrong /.
the judgement that has not proven to be wrong uh tim is that the region is changing in fundemental ways and the region is better without saddam hussein /.
yes it is true that uh everyone thought he had weapons of mass destruction /.
he did not /.
it is by the way the case that the iraqis are delighted to be rid of him /.
and some iraqis uh most iraqis in fact uh are willing and uh want to keep coalition forces there until they can uh take care of this themselves /.
but we do have to keep things in historical perspective /.
these people are doing something that is quite unknown in the middle east /.
and one has to ask what was the alternative /?
was the alternative to leave saddam hussein in power uh continuing to threaten his neighbors continuing with his uh windfall profits from the oil for food scandal continuing to repress uh his people and build mass graves uh continuing to uh use those oil for food profits to again build the infrastructure for his weapons of mass destruction /?
but many will say he was contained by the no - fly zone /.
ah i do n't think that there is anyone i i do not think that he was in a box /.
he was in a box /.
it i- the oil for food program alone shows that the billions of dollars that he was collecting /-
he was not just going to build palaces /.
this was someone who had an insatiable appetite uh to dominate his region /.
now without saddam hussein you can look across the region and see that uh a lot is changing thanks to the president 's democracy uh promotion and the hard work of people in those countries /.
you have syrian forces out of lebanon /.
you have uh saddam hussein out of uh iraq /.
the people of the middle east are taking on authoritarian governments across the middle east /.
kuwait has given women the right to vote /.
i 'd be the first to say that these big historical changes are turbulent and they 're difficult /.
but the notion that somehow there was a placid middle east , that if we just left it alone , if we 'd just not invaded iraq , if we had just not overthrown dictators , if we {had?} just not challenged syrian power in lebanon everything would be just fine uh is simply not true /.
it was that middle east the malignancy of the middle east that we quote unquote disturbed that led directly to the september eleventh event /.
the president said this week that whether there 'll be troops in iraq for the f- unforeseeable future will be determined by the next president meaning we 're going to have troops in iraq at least through january of oh nine /.
oh the president was asked this question in a particular way /.
and he e- answered that uh some american troops may well be there for the next president /.
but i would just point to what uh the president has said continually which is that american forces are going to come down uh commensurate with the need as iraqi forces stand up /.
and they are indeed standing up /.
general casey has talked about a significant reduction of american forces over the next year /.
and that significant reduction is because iraqi forces are taking and holding territory now because during this most recent uptick of sectarian violence the iraqi army uh uh behaved very very well /.
so iraqi forces are getting better /.
american forces are ceding territory /.
and i think it 's entirely uh probable that we will see a significant draw - down of american forces over the next uh next year /.
that 's what general casey believes /.
was /-
this year /.
it 's all dependent on the ground but this i- on on events on the ground /.
but as general casey has said we see the progress with iraqi forces /.
we see the progress of the political process /.
and uh there 's every reason to believe that american forces can start to draw down /.
is the insurgency in its last throes /?
well the insurgency uh politicially is certainly in in danger because {of?} the sunnis who stood outside of the political process /.
but in terms of violence is it in its last throes /?
well i- the insurgency is still able to uh to pull off violence and kill innocent children or kill an innocent school teacher /.
yes they are able to do that /.
and they might be able to do that some ti- for some time /.
but what they 've not been able to do is to disrupt the political process /.
what they 've not been able to do is to set iraqis uh one against another in the political process /.
they 've not been able to stop three elections /.
they 're not able to stop formation of uh the government /.
uh a few violent people can always uh grab headlines and can always kill innocent people /.
it 's more than a few /.
well it 's a few in terms of the population of iraqis /.
but it could not exist without being enabled by the population /.
well the population is less and less enabling every day /.
there are reports that zarqawi and al - qaeda meet stiff resistance indeed violent resistance from iraqi tribes /.
sunnis are now a part of the political process /.
and i know that people wonder when will the government formation finish /.
uh it it seems to be dragging on after the election /.
but i would just note i read the other day someone said well they 're dividing up the spoils of the offices /.
that 's not what they 're doing in this process /.
they are writing a government program on which the national unity will govern /.
they are writing the rules by which they will govern /.
and they 're defi- they 're trying to determining who will take key positions /.
so this is uh an extraordinary matter an extraordinary scene with iraqis sunni and shia and kurds all working together toward a unity government /.
let me turn to afghanistan /.
there 's a story moving on the wires that the afghan court has just dismissed the charges against this gentleman who had converted to christianity /.
are you aware that was going to happen /?
i i ca n't confirm uh that particular report uh tim /.
i know that the afghans are working on it /.
they 've been very aware um of the issue and of the concerns about the issue /.
this is a young democracy that is uh working with a constitution that uh like many constitutions when they 're first born uh e- th- the conflicts have to be worked out /.
w- we have our own history of conflicts that had to be worked out after a new constitution /.
and so um the afghans are working working on it /.
but america has stood solidly for religious freedom uh as a a a bedrock the bedrock of uh of uh democracy /.
and um we 'll see /.
but i ca n't confirm that specifically /.
should american christian missionaries be encouraged to go to afghanistan /?
well i think that afghans are uh pleased to get uh the help that they can get /.
we need to be respectful of afghan sovereignty /.
including christian missionaries /.
we have to be respectful of afghan sovereignty and tim respectful of the fact that this is a country that is coming out of twenty - five years of civil war a country that 's going to have to find its own way and a country that is going through one of the most difficult uh debates that any society goes through /.
and that is the proper role of religion in uh the politics of the state /.
it 's a debate by the way that all of us went through at some point in our history /.
but madame secretary we talk all the time about spreading democracy /.
and your own state department report on human rights abuses said afghanistan ha- eh says that christianity is punishable by death that a missionaries christian missionaries are not welcome that women can not get a a passport or leave the country without permission of a man /.
this is a far cry from the responsibilities and rights given to most people who live in a democracy /.
i- it 's also a far cry from the taliban /.
this is a country that has come an enormous way in four years where yes the uh issues of the constitution are going to be debated in this very traditional society that is trying now to move to a modern political system /.
i would just ask people to remember how hard this was for us /.
tim i am i hate to say fifty one years old /.
but it 's in my lifetime that uh black americans were guaranteed the right to vote /.
who are we to be uh so uh eh so insistent that people must do this overnight /?
we 're d- working with the afghan government /.
they 're moving in a democratic fashion /.
it 's going to be hard /.
but when something arises uh as with mister rahman it is the obligation of the international community and the united states and there has been support across europe for this that the afghans be reminded that in their own constitution they have enshrined the universal declaration on human rights which guarantees certain religious freedoms /.
we did n't have that constitution with the taliban to work with /.
so christians should be able to worship /?
people should be able to convert to christianity in afghanistan /.
o- of course tim /.
that our eh the universal declaration of human rights is is clear on this /.
but i would have to say that afghans are going to have to work through some of the difficulties and contradictions /.
but it ca n't be done on a case by case business /.
it has to be ensured /.
they will have to work through court cases as we have to interpret the +constitution /.
they will have to work through individual cases /.
and i 'm quite certain that the evolution of afghan democracy is going in the right direction /.
but i would just remind people that four years ago the taliban was executing people wantonly in uh stadiums for playing music /.
this is a country that has come a very very long way /.
and women were not being educated uh at all /.
it was punishable to educate women /.
this is a place that has come a long long way /.
let 's support them in uh their quest to become a a modern democracy /.
you mentioned you 're fifty one /.
and i 'm curious if it 's time for a career change /.
we 've discussed uh uh future options for you on this program /.
here was the headline all across the paper /.
nfl commisioner paul tagliabue step down in july /.
and here 's our conversations in two thousand one two three and four on this subject /.
in your next life you want to be commisioner of the nfl /?
right /.
i think the nfl is really a terrific institution /.
and i 'd love to be associated with it one day /.
another first /?
uh i- tim i 'm going off to be commisioner of nfl /.
remember /?
i think paul tagliabue 's doing a fine job as nfl commisioner /.
but um i look forward to uh the day that he decides to retire /.
and uh i i very much think that the the best job in america 's got to be nfl commisioner /.
you just announced your candidacy /.
i i still think the best job in america may be nfl commisioner /.
it 's a little too soon for me /.
i 've got lots to do as secretary of state /.
and i i think my ship came in /.
it 's going to have to leave the port without me /.
so you 're not interested /?
no not interested /.
now fred barns a reporter uh uh has close t- ties to the eh sources to the white house wrote this in the wall street journal the other day /.
a third time for bush the president 's most spectacular move would be to annoint a presidential successor /.
this would require vice president cheney to resign /.
his replacement /?
condoleezza rice who mister bush regards highly /.
we 've got a great vice president of the united states in uh vice president cheney /.
uh he is uh doing a fantastic job for the president and uh for the country /.
um he is really one of the strongest uh supporters th- that uh i 've drawn on from time to time /.
and uh he 's doing a great job /.
i think i 'd better try to be secretary of st- /-
you just gave a whole list of things i have to work on as secretary of state /.
but if the president c- if the president came to you and said dick cheney 's going to resign i want you to be my vice president because i want you to run in two thousand eight you would n't say no /.
i- tim ah i think we 've been through this conversation about two thousand and eight /.
not not going to t- i 'm not going to do that /.
that 's not what i want to do with my life /.
laura bush said you 'd make an excellent president and i do n't think we can talk her into running /.
uh well that 's is i really appreciate that the first lady who i admire very much uh thinks that /.
but the last part of that 's right /.
will not happen /.
i do n't think it 's going to happen /.
madame secretary as always we thank you for shar- sharing your views /.
thank you very much /.
coming next , david broder elisabeth bumiller charlie cook john harwood interpret the washington political landscape tackle the issue of immigration and look at the midterm elections in two thousand six /.
right here on meet the press /.
the politics of immigration iraq and the midterm congressional elections /.
david broder elisabeth bumiller charlie cook john harwood a round table after this station break /.
and we are back /.
welcome all /.
immigration /.
look at these scenes and these pictures from los angeles /.
five hundred thousand people according to police estimates turned out to protest some of the immigration reforms that are being discussed debated perhaps legislated in washington /.
david broder how big of a political issue is immigration /.
and what are the potential pitfalls for politicians as they try to navigate the issue /?
it started as a border issue in uh states that have common boundaries with mexico particularly /.
uh it has now become a national issue /.
talking to republican governor of minnesota it 's a big issue in his state /.
suburban t- illinois districts now find large hispanic populations /.
it has become a much tougher issue for politicians of both parties but particularly i think for republicans /.
the polling we have seen with the wall street journal nbc eighty - eight percent say it 's a serious problem /.
sixty - two percent say that illegal illegal immigrants should not be allowed to become citizens /.
and sixty percent say that we should n't even give them guest worker status to come here temporarily /.
elisabeth bumiller you wrote a piece in the new york times quote bush is facing a difficult path on immigration talking about the joint pressures on president bush from the business community we need these people to work because americans wo n't do the jobs and the conservative community saying i- illegal immigrants get them out /.
what does he do /?
he 's trying to uh thread the needle and walk a very fine line between both of these groups /.
i mean inches he 's a you know a governor of he 's a former governor of a border state /.
so he this is very close to his political experience /.
emotionally he is i- in the early days of this debate in two thousand four he was giving very emotional speeches about america the land of immigrants /.
and he was proposing this this very what many republicans said was a very generous guest worker program /.
um he has pulled back a lot now ah under under onslaught from from conservatives /.
and now he 's emphasizing the border security part of his plan /.
he 's trying to do both /.
there 's a lot as we know there 's a lot of different proposals on the hill right now /.
we 'll see some of them next week /.
um the white house is hanging back waiting to see what what comes out of th- out of the smoke /.
and then we 'll we 'll weigh in /.
charlie cook it appears that the american people have very firm views about immigration and that the president and other politicians are kind of trying to nuance the issue /.
is that possible /?
well it 's a funny issue /.
if you ask me what 's the most important problem facing the country it 's a small single digit issue /.
but then once you raise it boy emotions run high /.
and it 's hard to split the baby /.
and and i can see where the president 's trying to go the let 's build build a wall or build a barrier stop illegal immigration /.
but for the people we have we got to mainstream them and keep this workforce going because that 's important for agribusiness and business /.
is that politically acceptable to conservatives /?
eh it 's not acceptable to anybody /.
but it 's the only way i think /-
i mean they 're going to have to figure out a way to split the baby because one way or the other is is is is just not going to work /.
john /?
well let 's do n't forget tim democrats are also split on this issue /.
lot of african - americans are not very sympathetic with the cause of the guest worker program /.
uh the white house one of the ways elisabeth mentioned trying to thread the needle one of the things they were looking at is trying to push the final resolution of this until after the midterm election /.
that also could happen on some budget issues as well as a way of trying to make some sort of common cause between moderate democrats and moderate republicans /.
you know in two thousand florida florida florida /.
two thousand four ohio ohio ohio /.
you look at two thousand eight that electoral college map /.
and you look at states like new mexico and arizona and colorado some real potential swing states /.
and this issue could be very decisive as we play it through /.
well let 's do- do n't forget one other thing tim /.
this was raised in the virginia governor 's race last year by the republican candidate who went after some of these job centers that attract illegal immigrants /.
did n't work for him /.
so sometimes the emotion of the issue does n't always prevail /.
let me turn to iraq the big discussion in our country about iraq the way the issue is being covered by the media /.
uh vice president cheney last sunday made these comments /.
there 's a constant sort of perception if you will that is created because what 's newsworthy is the car bomb in baghdad it 's not all the work that went on that day in fifteen other provinces in terms of making progress towards rebuilding iraq /.
secretary of defense rumsfeld weighed in /.
the terrorists seem to recognize that they 're losing in iraq /.
i believe that history will show that to be the case /.
fortunately history is not made up of daily headlines blogs on the websites or the latest sensational attack /.
and then this wednesday president bush went to a town meeting in west virginia of his supporters /.
and 's one of the questions that was asked /.
and i ask you this from the bottom of my heart for a solution to this because it seems that our major media networks do n't want to portray the good . they just want to focus /-
okay hold on a second /.
they just want to focus on another car bomb /.
or they just want to focus on some more bloodshed /.
does that issue work that th- it 's the mainstream media that 's distorting the good news that 's coming out of iraq /?
i think it helps with the republican base /.
but i do n't think it helps with swing voters at all /.
first of all it 's the nature of news /.
i mean on the evening news at night a car that is n't in a wreck is n't in the news /.
a house that does n't burn a building that does n't burn a killing that does n't take place /.
news is is the aberration is the change from normalcy /.
secondly this uh eighty journalists so far have been killed over there /.
um i mean it 's it 's it 's i mean getting out there and looking around wandering around iraq looking for good news sounds to me like a good way to get killed /.
and then the third thing is that i i do n't know if they really want to try to sell this because people do n't think that that uh that everything 's fine /.
i mea- i think this is just an extenuation of holding the banner that says mission accomplished /.
the people do n't think it 's well /.
they can see that it 's not going well /.
and what happens in fifteen provinces does n't matter /.
what if they think that this thing is just really going to hell in a handbasket um it 's ki- i mean that 's you know that 's that /.
david broder /?
the ombudsman at the post deborah howell has a very thoughtful analysis of this question in the paper today which i would refer people to /.
i think the answer is that when there is this level of violence and turmoil in a country that has to be the heart of the story that the press is is telling /.
the other parts of it do get told /.
but they do not dominate the news /.
and they ca n't dominate the news given the realities of that country /.
nor should they dominate the news /.
it 's a very weak argument /.
when when you have as charlie said journalists over there who can not move around the country to report because they know that that they 're in danger of being killed at any moment that tells you about the state of security in the country /.
it 's not good /.
the white house /?
y- the other thing that 's interesting what you did n't show was the president 's response to her /.
i was there that day /.
and he was very very careful not to jump on her bandwagon /.
in fact uh i mean obviously he did n't have to /.
she did it for him /.
but the point is he said look , wait a minute /.
you know um i understand your frustration /.
but um we have a free press in this country /.
we ca n't tell them what to do /.
he pulled back somewhat from her comment /.
and i think you 're right charlie that they are n't they know they ca n't sell this and when they 've tried in the past it has backfired on them /.
but the president also said do n't be afraid to go to blogs and find out some more information /.
yes i mean s- i mean i 'm d- i 'm these are gradations here in wh- in white house response /.
but is the white house convinced that in order to secure the base of the republican party for the president it does n't hurt to go after the media a little bit /?
not n- of course not /.
they do it all the time /.
and uh and they complain all the time about about about what we do /.
but but i i have noticed this past week scott mcclellan saying the white house press secretary you know we 're not blaming the media for the war in iraq /.
he said that a couple times this week /.
and so so it 's i- they 're they 're again they 're being a little more careful here than usual /.
and did you really fall asleep in that press pool /.
or was that a cheap shot by the president /?
that 's completely inaccurate /.
i wo n't say i have n't nodded off in previous speeches but not that one /.
there is a difference +between difference +between meditation and sleep /.
the uh david broder let me turn to the the rebellion that i sense with some house members uh particularly in the republican party when you go talk to them privately /.
you captured it in your column this way /.
the conflict over the dubai ports world brought to the surface deep - seated resentments from the capitol end of pennsylvania avenue toward the people around the president and surprisingly toward bush himself /.
the harmony that had prevailed during most of bush 's tenure the deference that a republican controlled congress has generally shown to his wishes disappeared /.
even the normal circumspection with which congressional republicans treat the white house withered in the heat of this dispute /.
and then this /.
congressman tom davis of virginia a committee chairman told the post this is probably the worst administration ever in getting congress ' opinion on anything /.
ouch /.
well you had heard this kind of comment all of us had privately from republicans on the hill /.
but the fact that somebody like tom davis former chairman of the republican congressional campaign committee is saying it publicly on the record s- uh gives you a measure of the sort of fall - off of any sense of either loyalty or intimidation whatever you want to call it to the white house /.
uh they uh feel that they 're on their own and that the president is going to take care of his business but they 're going to take care of their own /.
one of the things being talked about elisabeth bumiller is the staff shake - up at the white house /.
this is how you reported it /.
republicans outside the white house say that had pushed mister bush uh not to replace karl rove the chief uh political operator deputy uh chief of staff but rather to bring in someone at the same level or above perhaps as minister without portfolio /.
one republican said mister bush should view it as replacing a top - notch pitcher struggling in the later innings of a baseball game rather than as a vote of no - confidence in a friend /.
so who 's the reliever /?
well there 's lots of names that they /-
you 've heard them as well as i have /.
ed gillespie uh you know bill paxon /.
there 's lots of names /.
um the question is are they going to do it /.
and and right now there 's there 's a lot of talk at the white house /.
there 's no indication that the president has signed on to this idea /.
karl rove has told people that he thinks that bringing somebody in without a clear line of authority is a mistake /.
it and and uh th- the bottom line is what is this going to d- is this going to help with the war in iraq /?
it 's going to help with you know tha- that 's it 's is it goi- you know we 're n- we 're not talking about changing policies here /.
we 're changing about you know changing you know some some personnel /.
so i- that 's /-
it 's unclear if anything 's going to happen /.
john /?
well chances are pretty good something will happen /.
the president of course did n't rule out the idea of bringing someone on /.
bill paxon 's a possibility /.
vin weber 's also a possibility /.
and i think over time you could see some changes in the white house staff as well /.
when you look at sort of the the big three or or th- the biggest names in the white house andy card karl rove dan bartlett you could see some change over time /.
andy card probably the most likely to leave at some point /.
he 's almost uh already the longest serving chief of staff ever /.
you could see some change there /.
on on the verge of dethroning sherman adams of dwight eisenhower fame /.
you bet /.
uh let me turn to the midterm elections where th- all these things +invariably lead /.
(advp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (rb here 's our latest numbers in the wall street journal poll right track wrong track /.
united states headed in the right direction twenty - six percent /.
one of four /.
sixty - two percent say wrong track /.
and the so called generic question who do you want to control congress /.
republicans thirty - seven percent /.
fifty percent now a majority say the democrats /.
but as always charlie cook is warning of us to go slow /.
and 's his latest column from the national journal /.
despite national political trends indicating that the gop is in serious trouble a race by race micro-analysis suggests that democrats can not easily seize control of the house or senate this fall /.
in the senate democrats need a net gain of six seats /.
democrats need to win in tennessee where bill frist is retiring have to run the table by defeating all the most vulnerable republicans while holding all of their own seats including in minnesota where their incumbent is retiring and in washington state where senator maria cantwell faces a very strong challenger /.
they also need to hang on to somewhat more secure open seats in maryland and vermont as well as fourteen other incumbents /.
although not impossible in a favorable +political political climate this is a very tall order /.
and here are the vulnerable states according to the cook report /.
uh vulnerable senators conrad burns in montana lincoln chafee rhode island mike dewine ohio santorum in pennsylvania jim talent missouri and the tennessee seat /.
charlie what do you see in the senate /?
this is you know when you look at this election from the big picture the national numbers boy just looks horrible /.
and it looks like gosh republicans will be lucky if they hold onto anything /.
and then you do the race by race like this /.
now the thing is the first three or four for democrats probably are n't that hard /.
but when you get to the fifth and sixth seats you get to to to winning in ohio and you wi- and an- an- talking about the tennessee open seat /.
gosh that 's hard /.
i mean it 's going to take a real real real strong wind up their backs /.
and and it 's the kind of thing where there 's structural barriers /.
i mean eighty - five percent of all incumbent senators get reelected /.
and you 've got to knock out five of them /?
now it can happen /.
but it 's hard /.
and it 's kind of like having uh structural barriers that are out there that are protecting the republican majorities /.
and if this is a category one two or three hurricane those barriers are strong enough /.
but if it 's a four or five they 're not /.
and the question is how tall it will it be /.
and tim some of the- some of those ranges races can change overnight in a hurry /.
conrad burns has now got a primary challenge from a significant republican /.
there 's some talk among republicans that maybe conrad burns would find something else to do maybe in the bush administration /.
that could change in a hurry /.
charlie you also say this about the house /.
in the house where democrats need a net gain of fifteen seats only about three dozen are truly in play today /.
so it 's it 's i- tough /.
and you have to get a a a s- a straight an inside straight /.
right there 're basically twenty - four republican seats that today are vulnerable /.
democrats have to win fifteen out of twenty - four and hold on to their eleven most tou- the toughest ones /.
and again they can do it /.
the- there d- i- if if there were more republican retirements in tough districts , if uh /-
but redistricting and the incumbency advantages that have built over the years just make pulling this kind of win hard unless it 's a category four or five /.
well in in nineteen ninety - four you talked about micro-changes thirty to thirty - five seats in the house /.
and the tsunami came /.
republicans won fifty - two seats uh electing newt gingrich speaker of the house /.
newt gingrich has now weighed in david broder and said that the democrats ' slogan in two thousand shits six should be had enough /.
and he thinks that would work /.
what a l- helper gingrich is /.
uh i think the democrats ' real slogan may very well be would n't you like to have somebody watching the store because the sense that i get from talking to voters is that they are not ready to entrust the government to the democrats but they 're not really comfortable th- with the way the republicans have been running things /.
and the simple idea of having a little oversight uh little checks and balances back in the system is potentially a really powerful argument for democrats /.
elisabeth bumiller when y- re- the white house hears little oversight checks and balances to them it means hearings with subpoena power /.
and they do n't like that /.
that 's right /.
no no /.
and you know karl rove has told people he 's optomistic they can hang on to both houses um uh if if /-
but he also has said yes it can happen the way charlie cook says /.
and you know you 're going to see the pre- /-
he 's the president 's out a lot these days campaigning already raising money for candidates /.
and uh he 's out in the all these big states /.
because the last thing the white house wants is investigation into weapons of mass destruction and to prison abuse and to religious rights in afghanistan /.
drop drop the issue /.
and there 's a hearing /.
ri- i mean it 's the last that 's the last two years of the bush presidency then /.
and they know that /.
that 's true tim /.
but let 's keep in mind first of all keeping republican majority is not the top priority for this white house /.
winning the war in iraq is the top priority /.
and secondly it might not be the worst thing to happen to george w bush if democrats had a weak majority /.
you could see some deals cut especially on entitlement programs the last two years if democrats try to resolve a problem before they hope they get a president in two thousand nine /.
david is it enough for the democrats to say we 're not the republicans period /.
or do they have to come forward with a specific proposal to deal with these problems including iraq /?
well if they 're going to be responsible they need some policy /.
and the great void on the democratic side is nobody can tell you today what their policy is about iraq about entitlements or about any of the other challenges facing the country /.
whether they need that politically somebody else is smart enough to decide /.
but if they 're going to be a responsible party they need to talk about policy /.
do they need to do it /?
see i would argue that minority parties do n't have to be responsible /.
that 's the one good thing going for them /.
and when they try to be responsible they 're just going to dig themselves into a hole /.
i mean y- you 're on y- your job is to throw rocks /.
once you start offering alternatives then suddenly you 're playing defense as well /.
i think democrats would be crazy from a political standpoint to offer up proposals /.
that c- movie cool hand luke sometimes nothing 's a real cool hand /.
exactly /.
elisabeth afghanistan a very thorny issue for this president uh who is uh very open about his christianity /.
and now we have the situation where it appears this gentleman who c- converted to christianity in afghanistan has been spared the death penalty /.
but it 's going an ongoing issue as secretary rice seemed to indicate as that democracy in afghanistan goes through some serious growing pains dealing with religious rights women 's rights civil rights human rights /.
right well this is what happens when you call for democracy in in problematic parts of the world /.
we saw this in the elections in the palestinian territories obviously /.
what do you do when you call for democracy and the wrong party wins on in your view /?
this was also going on a- in afghanistan /.
um the president was ver- /-
you know you saw him this week saying he ne- this was deeply troubling /.
um i was it would be interesting to know what was going on behind the scenes and wh- what kind of pressure was put on afghanistan our good ally /.
um obviously uh uh it looks like they got out of this one for now /.
john uh harwood secretary rice o- t- openly talking about american troop withdrawals /.
how much are politicans expecting to have significant troop withdrawals before the midterm elections /?
i think republicans are definitely expecting it and that could change the political environment /.
that 's one of the biggest drivers of this wrong track sentiment that we 've been talking about this morning /.
uh but eh as uh uh david discussed democrats do n't exactly have a clear voice /.
they 're going to try to finesse it this week and have an event drawing together all factions of the party behind criticizing bush and calling for some sort of transition without specifying exactly how it 's going to take place trying to to have an umbrella under which those who want to withdraw troops quickly and those who want to mo- go more slowly can all rally behind /.
is n't that the republicans ' hope david that by october enough troops have come home the president can then give a speech that w- says you see /.
we 're making progress /.
stay the course /.
do n't take a chance by going on with these other guys and doing something dangerous /.
if that happens the republicans would benefit /.
and the country would benefit /.
and uh let 's just hope that it 's possible /.
charlie cook politically will that be enough to deal with people 's anxieties concerns about iraq /?
that would help a lot /.
i mean your nbc wall street journal polls show that iraq was just a wet blanket over the administration /.
it was weighing everything down /.
and these republican members one of us one of them told us he comes in for the tuesday uh house republican conference lunch and he can tell who 's just gotten a poll back that they have this shell - shocked look on their face /.
somebody else said ashen /.
one other member said suddenly they start going into fundraising frenzies because they 're getting polls back in their individual districts that are starting to reflect those national numbers that look so horrible for them /.
it 's march madness for congressional republicans too tim /.
i 'll tell you that /.
speaking of march madness you 're a duke man /.
who do you like now /?

that 's the that 's the uh underdog pick right now /.

do you ever watch dateline nbc /?
yes /.
have you ever seen our stories on computer predators /?
yes /.
this is one of them /.
um , this is the first time i 've seen you , and i 've always wanted to ask you a question .
ah .
usually directors , otherwise , they have beards and very long hair , or otherwise they shave their heads .
oh .
oh ! i had n't thought about that .
actually a shaved head is really hard to manage , is n't it ?
do you have to shave it every day ?
right , yes .
um , when i 've slept so much i ca n't wake up , i just shave my head and i 'm awake .
and do you need to polish it somehow ?
then do you rub a little oil of some kind on it ?
oh , after i shave it i rub on a little oil .
is it cold in the winter ?
pretty cold .
do you wear a hat ? in the winter ?
it forces me to wear a hat .
that 's a question i 've always wanted to ask .
um , i 'm sure that there are many people when they introduce you , aside from saying director ye daying who has shot such and such , they ca n't avoid the cliche , they always have to say i 'd like to introduce marshall ye ting 's grandson .
your father , ye zhengming , was marshall ye ting 's second child .
right .
oh !
but today we 're telling ye daying 's story .
let 's start with when you were young . when you were young you were very naughty .
ye daying was born in changchun in 1958 .
although by that time his grandfather ye ting had been dead for 12 years , the ye family maintained its status as a highly esteemed communist household .
the next year the entire family transferred to beijing , and ye daying spent his childhood there .
he and his little friends went fishing , raised dogs , hunted sparrows , chased ducks , and many years later these supremely happy memories are all preserved in his movies and plays .
one , two , three , four .
ducks were the most precious asset in our village .
the village mayor gave them all to me .
the mayor said to me , there are eighty - six in all ; he had me check to see that there were none missing .
but i never did count them all carefully .
77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86
did you see ? are there 86 of them ?
yes .
ye daying 's mother , an qi , was an educated woman who worked at the changchun film studio .
and his father , ye zhengming , was an outstanding son of the revolution .
because after the wannan incident ye zhengming and his father ye ting were imprisoned for two years in a kuomnintang prison .
but then , and for the same reasons , just after the cultural revolution started , ye zhengming was treated as a major capitalist roader .
that year ye daying was just eight years old .
his family 's sudden misfortune left the young ye daying with very disturbing memories .
he changed from a very well - behaved child into a naughty child .
from that time on he often did things that went beyond the norm , sometimes to protect himself and sometimes to take care of his family .
ye daying just corrected us he said that ye ting should not be called marshal ye ting but rather general ye ting .
right , right , right , general ye ting .
why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?
um , he died in '46 .
that marshal , afterward , after liberation , um , it was conferred on him , so only then --
ok , we 'll call him general ye ting .
mm .
because ,
very naughty ? to what extent were you naughty then ?
in fact i was a very well - behaved child .
but i was forced , forced into it , there was no way , if you were n't naughty there was no way to survive .
what do you mean forced into it ?
during the cultural revolution , the , um , my family was considered capitalist roaders .
so the kids then did n't want to play with you , or they would tease you , that sort of thing .
mm .
so you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,
why was that ? was it because people for example would say that your father was such and such , or your family was such and such .
right .
so it was because of that sort of thing ?
right , the majority of it was like that .
mm .
mm .
because you had to face them alone , ok , a dozen people who wanted to fight you .
you had to show your stuff right off the bat , and you had to be tough .
so that was the only way , the only way you could overcome them and get the upper hand .
mm .
were you tough ?
mm .
very tough .
tough enough to --
because that , that , there was no way , if you were n't tough that was it , this , this , how could you manage .
you were the son of capitalist roaders , you , you , you thought it was natural to be the object of bullying , and it 's perfectly normal .
mm .
i , i remember one time , we were digging out an air - raid shelter , that --
those , good kids , they went there and threw stones .
i did n't dare defend myself , so i just had to endure it for quite a while .
mm .
finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on the head , and and i got angry , so angry that i rushed out with a shovel and hit them with the shovel .
where did the shovel come from ?
from digging the air - raid shelter , it was there , right .
mm . so you picked up the shovel and rushed them .
did you crack somebody 's head open ?
mm , anyhow , yes , i cracked their head open , it was very tragic .
all of a sudden nobody was making a sound .
very --
once i fought back , for several years after nobody dared mess with me .
how many of them did you take out ?
i hit one of them and that was enough .
nopbody went to get the schoolmaster or somebody 's father ?
they did , and there was a huge fuss .
mm .
because when i was little , having a big fight like that .
mm . anyhow , more or less , on average , on average , every two years i changed school , and that 's how it had to be .
mm .
i remember one time the -- mm , also , when i was in fifth or sixth grade , someone yelled out , down with ye zhengming , he was yelling at me , and i had to fight them .
mm .
after the fight i went home , and my father was standing far away .
the , the , the factory , the , the , the , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters down with ye zhengming , the , the , the slogan .
mm .
i got accustomed to it while passing by at that time , and now when i think about it , it seems very much like a stage play .
mm .
back then i felt , looking at him standing so far away --
i walked over to him , and he said , um , you really do n't understand anything .
at the time i felt like i had a grievance .
and i felt , i was fighting for you , the people were cursing you , and i was fighting them .
in fact that 's the way kids think .
mm .
you think , you bastard .
what you say does n't count .
you come after me and i 'll take you down .
you come down , and i 'll take you down .
if you have balls , you come on down .
come on down .
come down .
come down , come on , fight , fight , fight .
i say you take a whack .
whack .
i 'm telling you , if you kill somebody you 'll pay with your life , do you understand ?
you guys , you 've already handed him over .
i sent someone .
ok , ok , i sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at me .
come on , take a whack at me .
take a whack at me .
your dad knows who broke the window .
take a whack .
take a whack .
take a whack .
are n't you willing to be friends with us ?
yes , i am .
he says he 's willing .
did you hear ? he says he 's willing .
ok , that 's all right , let 's go play .
this is a movie directed by ye , called there 's a place called wangjiazhan .
wangjiazhuang , right .
this is obviously him as a boy , uh , a memory of his childhood life .
right .
right .
which child is you . is this child you , or is that child you ?
actually we should be accurate this child 's experiences ,
so this child ,
um , right , right , right , because once i , i
my father was denounced , and then the rebels took us , took that child to see .
mm .
they denounced my father , so i was very indignant ,
they let a lot of people expose my father ,
mm .
then the day after i took a kitchen knife and ran over to their home , that research institute , the doorway and vowed that i 'd hack the guy up .
a kitchen knife a knife from your kitchen at home .
oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home .
then i was standing there , lots of people surrounding me , and in fact you ca n't just hack people up .
but i had already said it .
what did you say ?
said i have to hack him , have to hack , so it was more or less like this child .
but they , those adults standing around reasoned with me , said look , you do n't understand this .
if you do this , you 'll stir up more trouble , and then wo n't your dad be even worse off ?
in fact when they said that , my mind had already eased .
i could not lose the face this way , this , this , so then i ran over and took a whack at the door , to get an excuse for myself .
was it all ruined ? the door --
i slashed it twice .
um , was n't there any consequence ?
mm , there was no consequence , it was , i just let the adults reason with me .
mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years .
it had , had a great influence on me .
including that village , that environment , it 's all very familiar to you .
more or less , very close to me , this is a novel of .
mm .
mm . i , the reason i like it is because , um , it brings up lots of that kind of childhood memories .
mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in beijing .
what year was it that you moved to shanghai ? how old were you at that time ?
i was 10 , six , in '69 i was 11 years old .
mm .
mm , well .
in '69 at the age of 11 you went from beijing to shanghai .
mm , your living environment changed , but perhaps that mischievousness had n't completely passed .
mm , as he puts it , looking at it now , some of the memories can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days .
i went there every day and then they suspended classes , so , so i could n't go to school , could n't go to class .
mm .
so there , later i remember there was a -- mm . a guy in the engineering team , and he brought quotations from chairman mao and said to me , he said , now take this , now take these quotations from chairman mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .
a lot of people were very happy , very excited , because they were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?
right , but the problem
because i , i had never studied well ,
in 1966 the great cultural revolution came , and at that time ye daying 's family moved from beijing to shanghai to live .
his father ye zhengming was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day .
and the change of regions did nothing to change the violent nature of ye daying 's life .
he was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .
when you got to shanghai the environment changed ; did n't your whole person change ?
after i got to shanghai , the whole , settling into the , my father 's that , that , that ,
all that time , from '69 to '76 , i graduated from senior middle school , it all took place there .
mm .
at that time in school , there were some , organized some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in that class ?
right , right , you should , see , like study classes to educate good kids .
what kind of people were in your class ?
um .
anyhow , boys and girls who did not perform well , you could say they were little hooligans , they were all mixed in together in that class , and there were also some who had problems at home .
mm .
all of them , and every day i went there , and the classes were suspended , so , so they did n't let me go to school , did n't let me go to class .
mm .
so there , afterward , i remember there was am mm . a guy in the engineering team , and he brought quotations from chairman mao and said to me , he said , now take this , now take these quotations from chairman mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .
lots of fun .
mm .
so i was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study .
in fact it was n't that we did n't study , i think it was ,
this class really helped me a lot , i , sometimes in my life i think about this ,
mm .
that period was both a happy and a fun time .
because i was a good egg .
in this i go against the grain .
um , the thing is , good people are very , they 're all the same .
if you 're bad , you do what you want , and so this , you 're honest and so it 's easy to be free .
plus when you yourself have already decided that you 're a bad kid , then you , you achieve a kind of liberation , and you 're completely liberated and free .
i think that --
um , of course today we say , at that time , um , in that class of ours , they were n't all necessarily bad kids .
mm .
they just were n't like normal kids .
it was , it was like a brotherhood .
ah , and we did some things that were out of bounds .
mm , we helped each other .
very sincere , very sincere and good .
when he was in that class , ye daying received patient teaching every day .
at that time he encountered the first love of his life that still remains fresh in his memory .
this girl became the only light in ye daying 's dark life for several years .
in those days if a middle school student liked a fellow - student , how did he go about expressing that ?
um .
when i was a school kid , for example the , um , that girl , who ran the kitchen and was one of the better students in our class , i liked her .
mm .
i always felt , um , she can give you , give you more on your plate , put more things on your plate for you to eat .
and then the most obvious way was um , to go see a movie together .
mm .
it was ,
so already you could -- go see a movie i thought ,
that was it , that was it .
you just want to go see the movie , you do n't worry about holding hands or not , um , and that was great , the , the , the --
so you went to the movies with this girl ?
yes .
do you still remember what movies you saw ?
the flower girl .
i still remember that now .
mm .
she cried as hard as she could .
so seeing the flower girl was the equivalent of seeing titanic now .
oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry .
yes , crying her eyes out , a big film like that .
at the time i thought i would n't cry .
but the people all around were crying , and i thought if i did n't cry it would look bad .
so then you cried .
so then i thought , i should let my emotions go .
um , how was the girl , was she very pretty ?
i , now i remember that she was very pretty , mm .
mm .
she was a very good student .
ha ha , this --
how was it she liked you ?
at that time we did n't talk about it , if two people gave each other the eye and felt it was right , then ,
gave each other the eye , while you were in the class you gave each other the eye .
so , so , when we were in class , for example you ,
i remember how it happened , yes .
um . when we went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic .
mm .
mm .
so then , we 'd each pick up a piece of chalk and toss the chalk back and forth . and throw spitballs .
i threw it at someone else but missed , and it hit her .
the result was that she turned her head to look .
and she looked at you angrily .
i thought , uh-oh , the expression in her eyes was like she would forgive you , that kind of feeling .
i thought wow , it 's so wonderful , that kind of feeling .
mm . that 's how it was , i should say .
it was like that ?
mm .
many years later , afterward , we graduated from senior middle school , and i was still going to see her .
mm .
the
so , so , so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right .
you graduated from middle school in '73 .
'74 . mm .
graduated from midle school in '74 .
mm , that female schoolmate went to the shanghai suburbs to live and work .
right , right , yes .
ye daying went to work in a factory ; at that time your monthly wages were 41 yuan , forty - some yuan ?
mm , when i started it was a technical school .
then at first it was 13 yuan , (np-tmp=1 (dt the first year yuan ; the second year it was 15 yuan , and the third year it was 41 yuan .
mm .
mm .
41 yuan , at the time , for him , it was a , an astronomical sum , um , a lot of money .
it was a lot of money .
in 1976 , there were two happy events in the ye family .
the first was that his father , ye zhengming , was released and reunited with his family that he had been separated from for three years .
the second event was that ye daying had his 18th birthday and became an adult .
with the turn for the better in his father 's political circumstances , ye daying left behind his violent life and changed suddenly , becoming more inward - looking .
in 1978 the big news was that the college entrance exams would be reinstated nationwide , and people of ye daying 's age were thrilled .
however , at this time ye daying , facing this opportunity that would change his fortune , was at a loss as to what to do .
you thought those days were pretty good , did you not think about getting into the university ?
oh my , in fact , '78 , for me , was an especially depressing time .
mm .
mm .
up to then , um , i had never thought about the future .
mm .
i thought everybody was the same , your fate settled things for you , um , you either go to a place live and work , or you became a -lrb- factory -rrb- worker .
in society , being a worker was already not so bad a thing , um , a way to move ahead .
um , in '78 suddenly they reinstated the college entrance exams .
at that time , in '78 , i was 20 .
a lot of people were happy , very excited , because they reinstated the college entrance exams why were you feeling depressed ?
right , but the problem was , i , because i , i had never done well in school .
so right off i felt that i was finished , the --
those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school , they could , compared to me , they had a future , um , they could stand out .
mm .
so i was hopeless , right off i was feeling down .
very clearly a --
if you wanted to take the exams , what kind of score did you think you 'd get .
i did n't take the exams , i did n't have the nerve , i did n't try , so --
it was very , the extraordinary thing was , at that time my mom was attending the film institute , she was an instructor there .
mm .
mm , i had n't thought , i , that i would work in the movie .
mm . she , um , she wanted to send the recruitment announcement to a friend 's house .
mm .
so then i --
one day she sent me to deliver it , and so i picked it up and read it , and once i read it , oh ! the directing department of the film institute , inside , no language exams , no math or physics or chemistry exams , and i thought wow ! this is just the ticket .
let 's run off to try and see .
i thought you 've loved movies ever since you were little , and then every day sitting in the movie theater you thought , i want to be a director .
no , i did n't , no .
it was just because there was no english exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry .
right , it was very simple .
mm .
one more thing , because in '78 , the beijing film institute was recruiting students in shanghai
right .
so , ye daying went to take the exams for the film institute , but did n't pass the exams .
his mother , an qi , had never thought that ye daying would sign up to take the exam for her work unit , the beijing film institute .
but ye daying in fact failed when he took the reinstated exam .
although it was the first time he had taken the exam , it left ye daying even more convinced that movies were something he could do .
the next year , 21 - year - old ye daying passed the entrance exam for the actors training class at the xi'an film studio .
being an actor was not his goal ; he hoped rather to get into the directing profession .
at that time you especially admired directors , right ?
mm , because after i got to the xi'an film studio , um , i discovered i had the shakes when i got on stage .
mm .
mm . now , here chatting with you , i feel , um , it does n't matter .
even today , in front of the lens , i 'm a nervous wreck .
mm , very tense .
did you act then ?
of course , every day we had to , um , it was n't just recitation , so , doing sketches , this and that .
i thought , this is definitely not working .
just getting on stage gave you the shakes .
then , i was really , no , it was n't my thing , this , i could n't find out why , and besides in those days ,
um , it was in '80 that i went to the xi'an film studio ,
mm .
at that time it was all , it was , always that kind of pompous stuff , or that kind of , that milquetoast kind of young male character , that kind of thing .
and i 'm not that kind of person , so i could n't get my bearings .
so then at the same time when i saw that teng wenji , he was probably thirty - some years old , he was the previous generation to us , very stubborn .
mm .
mm . that projecting force of his , i thought wow , this , that 's really good .
he could really project .
because ultimately , there , i gradually realized this .
mm . and i would be in the audience and see him directing on site .
mm .
mm , i could see how they worked .
in fact in the beginning the attraction to movies was all these things , i thought it was really a bunch of fluff , i thought , that 's really fun , that 's really interesting .
i thought who was stubborn , then i wanted to be that kind of person , but that did n't mean i knew anything about that profession .
so no one ever came looking for you to do a play ? at that time --
mm , no one ever came looking .
they looked , but it was always just for an extra .
you did n't , you did n't even have any lines .
mm . that xi'an incident thing , i played an extra once .
there was a guy playing zhang xueliang , and i played his secretary going in to report to him , and i did it a few times but i was always in the wrong place .
what were your lines supposed to be ?
it was (`` " reporting , a telegram that sort of thing .
so you --
so i had never served as a soldier , that kind of pose , it was really awful .
so after i gave that up , no , it was not that kind of thing .
so the old director , cheng yin , um ,
mm .
he would say , this is an qi 's son , why is he like that ?
do you remember how many takes you did ?
oh , a lot . i think it was something like ten plus times .
it was too , i 'd walk badly and turn like that .
i , i attended that class for half a year , um , um and then i got sick .
um , i got , central , an inflammation of the central nervous system , so my whole body was paralyzed .
your whole body was paralyzed ?
right .
your whole body was paralyzed ?
right . i was paralyzed for ten months .
so you could n't move at all .
i could n't move at all . when it started , my leg went numb , then my hand went numb , and then it started cross over , like that , and then slowly , slowly , slowly i could n't move .
what 's the scientific name of the disease ?
it 's called guillain - barre syndrome .
it 's named after a foreigner .
mm .
ahem , if naming it somewhat common , it 's , a paralysis of the central nervous system , um , it goes from the nerve endings to the flesh , and then , then it turns into myasthenia .
and how did you get better , later ?
hormones .
you took hormones .
um , i got , every day i had a transfusion .
mm , after you get hormones , people may get very fat .
mm .
very fat . i 'm so fat now , but compared to then it 's much better , in fact .
at that time how fat were you ?
yah .
getting so fat , it was this , if i looked down i could see my own cheeks , so i thought i was really fat .
what do you mean ?
if i just look down , my cheeks are right here .
but after they finished with the hormones , i gradually got better .
mm . the flesh all atrophied , um .
if you look at when i was in middle school , based on that bit of exercise --
later , based on that , it all evaporated .
i 've heard it said that that wang shuo novel , which we later saw as a television play --
sometimes , oh , right .
mm .
get some fun .
get some fun . the language in that , the part wang zhiwen played , the disease he got is about the same as your disease , is n't it ?
right , right , right , right .
so sometimes , oh , it was me and wang shuo , together , it was , um , in '89 .
mm , together , um , wrote a .
aye , the script i wanted , the novel he wrote , um , that piece we created together .
mm .
therefore , at that time , we were talking and talking to shoot a , an urban love story , tell a love story , so he took me , at that time , that , more or less that story , as background .
mm .
then after i went back to beijning , when we made arrangement and were eating together , i saw wang shuo for the first time
then , when i saw him for the first time , wang shuo was holding a book in his arms , a book , that was floating on the sea , that novel he wrote , it was a sample .
mm .
gave it to me , and i took it back to school to read .
i read it and wow , that day i really was , i thought he would be able --
our generation could really find ourselves , i mean --
um , in the end i knew we --
why we studied movies , um , and why wrote things , expressing one 's own kind of thing is the most accurate person
ye daying had already read wang shuo 's novel love the hard way , and the story and the style it was written in made a profound impression on him .
he sighed , this expresses what our generation really wants to express .
later he was introduced by a friend , and ye daying met the author of the novel , wang shuo , at the film institute . that was the beginning of their long friendship , which continues today .
how many plays did you collaborate on ?
in june of 2004 , the shanxi yongji peasants association was formally established it now has 3,800 members .
accordingly , this is the first peasant organization to be legally registered and designated a peasant association since the founding of the prc . its president is zheng bing .
she says that two years before that they were already calling themselves a peasant association .
at the time the association was just set up , it ran into an issue . it really tested the association 's ability to deal with problems .
the school built a classroom building and put a lock on the gate door .
they invested more than 400,000 although they were poor , several hundred family heads made a ruckus .
the secretary telephoned , can our association get involved and resolve this matter .
i myself put up 1,000 yuan , and with 19 people we put together 10,000 yuan , and we went to negotiate with the contractor .
in the end , the contractor came around and let the kids go into the classrooms to attend classes .
the entire problem was resolved smoothly , and it greatly increased the prestige of the peasant association in the eyes of the local villagers .
but why did a peasant organization get involved in a matter that should have been resolved by the village party committee ?
will peasant associations become a direction of organized rural development ?
with these questions in mind , this reporter came to yongji in shanxi to get the scoop .
in fact i 'd heard about zheng bing 's aggressive approach early on .
but when i saw her , i felt she was someone who really wanted to be low key .
the minute i met her , she told me that what she did was terribly ordinary , and basically was n't worth our looking into .
and she spoke about her family , her husband and child , and she looked concerned and haggard .
and she would often sigh .
but when the subject of the peasants association comes up , and when talked about how she was organizing peasants and helping them improve the quality -lrb- of their lives -rrb- , zheng bing 's face lights up with a dazzling smile .
if you go 13 kilometers west of yongji in shanxi , you come to zhaizi village .
the yongji peasants association has its headquarters at the entrance to zhaizi village .
previously , zheng bing and her husband ran a chemical fertilizer store here .
now , they have donated the fertilizer store to the peasants association .
back in '97 , why did you think of giving technical training to the peasants ?
it was kind of by accident .
um , at the time , my husband ran a , uh , the zhaizi technical center , on the banks of the yellow river , which provided farmer 's financial services to the peasants .
while i was helping my husband , i discovered that the peasants were investing the money to buy fertilizer in a very haphazard way .
also , many of those peasants who came into the store to buy fertilizer , they 'd come into the store , and they really did n't have a clue , and they 'd think , so - and - so is buying that , so i 'll buy that , and they basically did n't know , they did n't go and choose something based on what their own land needed .
was it easy to get teachers to come to the village to give classes ?
the first time , in fact it was , the first time was unimaginable .
at the time , the attendance on that day , it was n't something like that .
the first time , organizing the first time , i , at the time that zhaizi technical center was seven or eight li from our village , and it was on the banks of the yellow river !
at the time i was afraid to ask the teacher to come because the peasants might not come to hear him , so at the time i ran from village to village , i went around organizing .
i spent two months running around to the ten villages that surround our village .
um , and at each village , i would go around trying to find out who had the most technology awareness .
then i 'd go to them face to face and say , we 're planning to hold a technical training would you be willing to come ?
finally , from the ten villages , i chose 80 women .
then i got them to bring peasants from surrounding area altogether .
were there people who could not get in to the class ?
more than 400 people came to the class that day .
so i went to ten villages , but it was n't just the 80 people , they all brought people from the surrounding area .
the class went on from just after 10 in the morning until five in the afternoon .
hey , when that class was over , many of the peasants had a lot of feedback .
hey , this , the class went great .
this class earned zheng bing more than she had expected .
nearby villagers all heard about this terrific person who dug deep into her own pockets to provide an agricultural seminar for everybody . and they all loved coming to the technical services center to buy things .
the next year , this shop of zheng bing 's took in more than 60,000 yuan .
furthermore , this center of hers became an agricultural technology exchange center for the surrounding area .
whenever villagers would run into some agricultural production issue , they all liked to come here to look for answers .
how many times since the end of '98 have you held similar training sessions ?
since december of '98 , each year we 've held four to six training sessions .
do you still need to provide the money for them ?
um , not necessarily . starting in '99 , because in '98 , that one training session , i spent 1,300 yuan .
and that year , the income i counted was 4,000 yuan .
therefore if we did a training session four times a year we were n't earning as much as we had to spend .
then we got to , in '99 , i went to our agricultural bureau , and to our municipal women 's association , because most of the people attending the training sessions were women .
when i went to our agricultural bureau , i thought , huh , the agricultural bureau has all those technical personnel , they ought to provide services to the peasants .
so , starting in '99 we , the municipal women 's association was very supportive of us , and they liaised for us in getting teachers from the agricultural bureau and the water conservancy bureau .
if we invited technicians from our yongji city , it 's free of charge .
starting with the technical training , the yongji peasant cooperative organization began to take shape .
aside from attening the classes , the peasants began to make demands of zheng bing , asking her to undertake some projects .
zheng bing thereupon set up a poultry - raising project , serving as guarantor for it she helped the peasants take out a loan from a credit union for 150,000 to participate in this project .
did you ever think what you 'd do if they could't pay off this 150,000 yuan when it came due ?
um , at the time i did n't , i did n't think about it probably because i was so positive about it .
but then it actually failed , alas !
a year later , it failed , failed , nobody paid back the money , and the credit union came after us .
but i did n't feel any regret , i looked for the reasons .
how could it have failed ?
so the 150,000 yuan , the head of the credit union wanted to take me to court , he said , i should pay it back , and i said (sbar-nom-tpc-3 (whnp-2 (wp what i was responsible for i would take care of .
if nobody wanted to pay it back , i would gradually pay it off .
but i could n't pay it all back in one year .
then i telephoned him given my actual circumstances , if i pay it back in six years , is that ok ?
the head of the credit union said it was n't ok , he wanted , he wanted to take me to court , he wanted to shut down my , uh , my store , and even confiscate my home .
in a farming village , 150,000 yuan is no small sum .
this burdensome debt took zheng bing 's breath away .
her husband 's not understanding and blaming her added to zheng bing 's psychological burden .
with this enormous , difficult - to - bear pressure on her , she did not understand how a good thing could turn out this way , and zheng bing left home .
but because zheng bing was the guarantor , the credit union still took zheng bing to court .
but then how was it that the credit union let you go ? they did n't shut down your shop again or require you to mortgage the shop .
at the time they filed a lawsuit against me , and the lawyer also came !
after the lawyer came , he explained these things to me , he said , the credit union has already filed suit against you .
i said , well then i still can not help with it .
the lawyer asked me , from a to z , what happened ?
so i explained it all faithfully .
after i explained it , the lawyer looked all astonished .
he said , i 'll go see the credit union , and -lrb- ask them -rrb- not to file a lawsuit .
so the lawyer sorted it all out .
so after the lawyer arranged it all , the head of the credit union said , finally we 've reached an agreement , and you can pay it back over six years .
so as of right now , i still have 65,000 yuan to pay .
so next year when the time expires , will you be able to pay off this 65,000 yuan ?
65,000 yuan from the start , if , if i do n't provide any more services to the peasants , i can pay it off .
but the peasants need lots of services .
ho !
there 's no way to stop it .
so , i discussed it with the credit union .
they 'll defer the interest for each year .
each year i 'll give them the interest .
then they can push the six years back again .
but it 's good that they can understand and agree to do it this way .
yow ! do n't shoot , do n't shoot -lrb- the film of -rrb- me , i do n't cry .
originally i was thinking i 'd help the peasants to raise their incomes , but because of that i took on a debt of 150,000 yuan , and i got taken to court .
in 1999 zheng bing quit her job as a teacher .
however , in running the fertilizer store , she often gave credit to poor peasants , which made her to have 110,000 yuan of credit could not be collected .
zheng bing thought of a way to resolve this problem , but she absolutely never imagined that because of it she would nearly end up in prison .
selling to them on credit like that , were n't you concerned that you would n't be able to get the money back in the future ?
ho ! if i could not collect on that big amount , i was thinking how will i be able to give the peasants credit to solve the peasants ' real problems ?
and how could i keep this from having a negative impact ?
i discovered that peasants are not entirely having no money .
so then , i was thinking , could n't the peasants join up with us in this fertilizer store by becoming shareholders ?
given the seasonal nature of peasant income , they 'd have to invest about 50 yuan each time .
so then , in practice , i let the peasants invest 50 yuan for each mu of land , invest 50 , 50 yuan .
then , after you 've become a shareholder , you can come at any time to get fertilizer .
then , at the end of the year , you can , we 'll settle up the differences .
and the amount you invested , if you 've invested , then we 'll take your money and buy fertilizer , sell fertilizer .
that is , the peasants bring in their own , and our store will take the peasants ' money and run this , the fertilizer store .
and was n't there anyone who said to you that this approach may have been considered an illegal way of raising capital ?
yes , and i thought , this village , how come good things are so difficult to do ?
the first year i did uh , eight in our village i did 20 households .
it had no impact .
by the second year , i began to really deal with everybody , and they all knew , and i made it public .
good grief ! at first , we , that credit union , good grief ! that service , everywhere they were saying zheng bing is raising capital illegally .
look , she 's cheating you out of your money !
if she could cheat you out of several tens of thousands and then she could leave the country !
these things really shook up our government .
our people 's bank , our association , they all came .
after they all came , they said to me , zheng bing , we need to investigate your business .
i said , why do you need to investigate ?
they said , we hear that you 're raising capital illegally .
because there , leaders of different sectors from our city , they all came here to us .
when they said illegally raising capital , i was startled .
i said , if it 's raising capital illegally , i 'll shut down right away , i wo n't do it anymore .
an accusation of raising capital illegally is not a small matter .
the bank investigated the matter ,
later it was persuaded and prevented by the city of yongji .
therefore zheng bing , fed up with scare , even though she was convinced that she should give up , she was really unwilling .
after thorough consideration , zheng bing made a surprising decision she donated the fertilizer store , with all of the profits going to pay the activity expenses of the peasant association .
essentially this fertilizer store enabled your family to earn money why did you want to give it away ?
because at the time everybody had become a shareholder , and once they had , it was everybody 's business .
you ca n't take everybody 's business and run it as your own , to make money for yourself .
so at the time i told my husband about this , and my husband , he did n't agree .
then do n't let everybody become a shareholder .
do n't let them become shareholders , then we 'll be able , be able to loan the money and get the business going .
oh ! but i felt , the peasants , they need this kind of service .
who would have guessed that my husband would be strongly opposed .
i worked with him again and again .
finally , he agreed .
since then , no one is saying anymore that she is raising capital illegally .
bing zheng , who sacrificed her own profits , gradually got the peasant association working better and better .
and a thing that came next made the villagers not only see that zheng bing had a spirit of sacrifice , but her organizing skills also could instill confidence in people .
in organizing the village women , how did the dancing part come about ?
i said why could n't it be like , like the women in the city , dancing in the summer .
they said what ? how can we be compared to the city ?
i said , why ca n't we be compared to the city ?
that day i went to the women 's association , to the women 's association , the women 's association gave us that , our yongji , invited teachers from the chunlei kindergarten .
wow !
that first time , the first afternoon , we first got together 20 - some women in our village to dance .
that afternoon we basically did n't dance a step ,
we laughed all afternoon .
laughed at what ?
they were embarrassed !
hah ! how can we peasant women , how can we dance !
because at the time , in the courtyard of our home , the teacher was very , extremely conscientious , and they were all laughing hard .
the whole afternoon , we did n't learn a single step .
but i saw that they were so , that kind , excited , and i felt , maybe this is the beginning of a new life .
so i persisted .
i persisted for a month .
just imagine , 80 % of our village , that is 120 women joined in .
after a series of women 's activities , the spirit of villagers in zhaizi village had changed .
on lunar january 1 , 2003 , zheng bing organized a large get - together in which the men participated .
there was a women 's stage performance , and the men held a chess tournament .
after that , it became popular among the villagers to call it the peasants ' association .
but in the end dancing and playing chess do n't achieve any real benefits for the villagers .
not long after , zheng bing and the key members of the peasants ' association did something that allowed the villagers to see the direct advantages of the peasants ' association .
when was the village construction council established ? why did you want to set up this body ?
our village had a reputation locally as having messy , messy lanes .
yikes ! after it rained , it was really tough to walk , so we went to the village committee .
at the time our village had a secretary who doubled as village head .
we went to see him .
we spoke to him three times , and they 'd always say no .
the reason they said no was , our village committee had no money .
we considered the village committee 's hardship ,
and the villagers discussed it collectively .
they decided to set up a village construction council , to focus on fixing up the lanes .
indeed , why were you confident that you could handle the matters that the village committee was n't able to ?
because we all discussed things together , very intensely .
because , first of all , these lanes are a matter of concern to all of us .
and if we do it ourselves , why should n't we be able to get it done ?
but the fact is that you yourselves selected the village construction council .
yes .
and it 's an autonomous institution , might it not clash with the village committee ?
there were no clashes .
for the selection , we did the selection if our village committee wanted to do this , it had this objective difficulty .
and now this village construction council of ours , there 's nobody who has anything against it .
so there 's none of this feeling of dependency .
so it 's possible to convince every family , every household to mobilize .
because it 's not , it 's everybody agreed .
in the end , it was actually very difficult to get this thing done , to complete it .
according to a yongji official , the reason the zhaizi village peasant association has had such a big impact , one major reason is the paralysis of the village committee .
many of the things that the village committee was originally supposed to do the peasants ' association now does .
the peasants have seen that the association has safeguarded for the peasants ' interests at crucial times .
zhaizi village has a total of 263 households .
the number of households that became members of the association went from over a hundred before the lanes were fixed to more than 200 .
on june 7 of last year , the yongji peasants ' association was formally registered at the civil administration bureau of yongji city .
its legal representative is zheng bing .
in november 2004 , the first business operated by the peasants ' association after it was registered , the zhaizi village paint plant , was set up and went into production .
in the shareholding issue , zheng bing and the association members ran into a succession of problems .
for construction capital , they adopted the member shareholding approach , with a total of 300 shares at 300 yuan per share .
zheng bing 's idea was that each member household could hold a maximum of three shares .
if they could n't sell that number of shares , they 'd let the members of the board of directors and its chairman buy shares .
but they could not exceed five shares and ten shares , respectively .
i heard many people say you made an arbitrary decision , with regard to the paint plant shareholding decision .
some people wanted to hold controlling shares , but you strongly disagreed .
and you absolutely did n't want to hear other people 's opinions .
yes .
that , as we were organizing that cooperative paint plant , that , the paint plant , some people proposed right away , at the meeting , they proposed , i want to hold controlling shares .
i said what we 're running is a cooperative , a cooperative paint plant .
it 's not a joint - stock company , the paint plant , because we had already announced that information in advance .
so then we began squabbling at the meeting .
you ca n't do it this way ,
that way is too arbitrary .
i said , first you go home and study up on what the coop system is all about , then come back and we 'll talk .
if you think you really want to hold a controlling share , i suggest you set up a plant on paper .
your aim in holding a controlling share , is n't it to use everybody 's capital to serve your own interests ?
but a short time later , everyone again clashed with zheng bing .
there are twelve households in the village that were categorized as retarded or disabled and extremely poor households .
zheng bing proposed giving one share to these households , with the capital coming from the association 's expenditures .
the 20 - plus directors and the chairman split up into seven groups to discuss the matter of giving shares to these twelve households not one person supported zheng bing 's idea .
but when zheng bing persisted , everyone finally agreed .
just now you repeatedly used a word , quality .
what quality is it that you 're referring to ?
every month we give the association members a report .
as we began this year , we put out a report , and the report had , it presented a goal , to become the number one village in china within ten years .
the association is now experimenting in zhaizi village .
of course some ask , some people ask you , this number one , what does that imply ?
i say , two things .
first , we want our villagers ' whole concept of the legal system to be the first in all of china .
second , we , we want the overall cultural quality of our villagers to be number one .
we are all set to be number one in these two areas .
this is the 10 - year goal we have established for ourselves .
but if we want to achieve these two number one's_ , it 's not just that you can say it and that 's it .
you have to constantly overcome your own traditional , conservative kinds of thinking and antiquated concepts .
you have to constantly challenge yourself .
so this quality thing , it really has a lot of meaning to it .
now that she has quit her teaching job , donated away her own family store , and with the development of the peasant association , the biggest issue for her now is still that of money .
the peasants ' association does n't collect any membership dues the six technical service centers that belong to it give the members a two - yuan discount on each sack of fertilizer .
they also let members buy on credit and pay it off at harvest time .
so how much of your family 's own money have you contributed ?
if you really total it up , my family has paid out more than 200,000 .
(pp-prp-tpc-1 (in for the peasants ' association , and organizing the peasants , you invested 200,000 - plus , such a huge sum , does n't that pain you ?
it does n't pain me i feel it 's very worthwhile .
at 3:42 on july 28 , 1976 , a strong earthquake hit tangshan .
on the morning of the 28th , the national earthquake administration called an emergency consultative meeting .
at the meeting , huang xiangning read the earthquake prediction that they had previously issued . this attracted the attention of people in the relevant fields .
at 10:30 p.m. , as huang xiangning was preparing to return home , he was met by people who led him away from the door of his home , and that night he reported to the country 's leaders on earthquake forecasting .
what sort of questions did hua guofeng ask then ? who else was there ?
oh , i , when i went in , there was , uh , mei shirong , the deputy director , he was the deputy director of the analysis and forecasting office in charge of , and director liu yingyong , that is the seismology bureau director at that time , they were both there .
as he reached the end of the report , mei shirong said , he thought he wanted --
the tangshan earthquake was a paroxysmal earthquake .
this type of earthquake has no precursors , and so it ca n't be predicted and you ca n't take precautions .
uh , that was the gist of mei shirong 's remarks at the end of the report .
but before this , you clearly had already reported this opinion to the analysis and forecasting office .
the report went to the seismology bureau , yes .
how could he say this ? this is absolutely contrary to the facts .
well , i do n't know , i guess it could have been , could it be , uh , that -lrb- he -rrb- was afraid that the responsibility was too much , so -lrb- he -rrb- blabbered out of a frightened mentality .
that 's my guess , maybe it was what he was thinking under frightening circumstances .
after i went there , after he finished the report , premier hua allowed me to report .
when i saw what was going on , i took the annual forecast , and i had no report .
so i , i went directly to discussing our short - term annual forecast , it was july 14 , the , i put it down on the table , and let them , read the original once , and then i reported , and they did n't interrupt at all .
i finished , and hua guofeng then said the , uh , the party central committee 's state council does not hold you comrades in earthquake prediction , earthquake industry responsible , we hope you will continue to do your monitoring and forecasting work to protect the party central committee and protect chairman mao . that was what they said .
but obviously what you said , the facts you stated , conflicted with what mei shirong had stated .
yes .
at the time , did n't anyone express any dissatisfaction over this ?
no .
oh , the national leaders did n't , they did n't raise any questions about this .
and no one suggested looking into the responsibility of the earthquake administration ?
no , they did n't .
uh , hua guofeng then said , uh , um , the , the gist of what he said was that no one 's responsibility would be looked into .
he said , you need n't have any concerns .
you , the , uh , when you go back , continue with your monitoring work , monitoring and aftershocks .
and protect the party central committee and protect chairman mao .
that was the gist of what hua guofeng said .
who else was in attendance at the time ?
(pp-loc-tpc-2 (in in attendance , uh , from the seismology bureau there were three of us , director liu yingyong , deputy director mei shirong , and me .
the , the national leaders were hua guofeng ,
oh , there was jiang qing ,
there was ji dengkui , there was wu de .
this was an informational briefing that hardly anyone knows about .
the time was january 20 , 1977 .
the briefing only had a total of 450 copies it was mainly committee leaders at the time who were reported to .
in the briefing , the national seismology bureau for the first time analyzed the reasons for the failure to report the tangshan earthquake .
the national seismology bureau believes , first , that it did not clearly recognize the relationship between anomalies and earthquakes , and it made errors in assessing the earthquake .
second , it did not recognize pre-earthquake anomalous signs .
third , it did not understand the seismological and geological signs in the beijing , tianjin , tangshan , bohai , zhangjiakou area .
these three lack of understandings made people feel quite a bit of guilty conscience .
were the reasons that led to so many deaths and injuries all that simple ?
the reports from the monitoring stations , the experts ' opinions all failed to be taken seriously by the relevant departments what kind of questions did this raise ?
and if the pre-quake predictions had been taken seriously , what result would that have led to ?
these are the relics and ruins left to us by the great tangshan earthquake .
in that calamity , all of tangshan was laid waste .
and yet in the county seat of qinglong county in hebei province , although it is only 115 km from here , not even one person in the whole county died in the great earthquake .
on the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the great tangshan earthquake , that is in april of 1996 , qinglong was chosen by a united nations agency to become a successful model for the integration of scientific research and administrative management .
in fact , on august 20 , 1976 , the hebei science committee had issued a brief report which for the first time revealed the facts about qinglong having successfully prepared against the great tangshan earthquake .
but the report was withdrawn very quickly .
right up until 1995 , when the united nations ' dr. kohl came to beijing to participate in the world conference on women and learned about qinglong for the first time .
the following year , after receiving permission from the chinese government , this female un official headed up a team in person and conducted an on - site investigation in qinglong .
beginning at that time , the qinglong phenomenon gradually became known to the outside .
speaking of the qinglong miracle , there are two people we can not forget one is wang chunqing and the other is ran guangqi .
at the time wang chunqing was in charge of seismic work for the qinglong county scientific committee , and it was he who first brought news of the great earthquake back to qinglong .
what do you think the reasons were ? why was qinglong able to do it and tangshan was n't ?
oh !
that 's really difficult to explain in a few words .
why do you say that ?
qinglong ! at the time i was participating , on july 14 , 1976 , i was participating in a joint survey and prevention conference .
the local manager was wang chunqing , the person responsible for running the qinglong county scientific committee was named wang chunqing .
he was also on the dais opening the conference .
opening this conference , at the time , wang chengmin of the national seismology bureau came .
when wang chengmin came , he demanded to address the conference , and he spoke to the bureau 's director , zha zhiyuan i want to address the conference .
zha zhiyuan would n't let him .
(sbar-nom-sbj-2 (whnp-1 (wp what the reason for that was never became known . he wanted to make a pre-quake speech , and he would n't allow it .
what was the reason ?
what reason ? he was the deputy director of the bureau , he was a group leader .
wang chengmin thereupon spent two evenings holding two colloquia .
wang chun , wang chunqing participated in the first colloquium .
because wang chunqing , uh , he participated in this meeting from start to finish .
ah .
wang chengmin then reported the pre-quake opinions of a number of units . pre-quake opinions that he had received .
he received these opinions and also heard that tangshan second middle school said so ,
uh , teacher tian jinwu of tangshan second middle school also said like that , that is , earthquake prediction is part of the three essential earthquake requisites , right ?
in late july or early august a 7.0 or higher , possibly even an 8.0 earthquake will occur , and this made a very strong impression on him .
when the meeting let out , wang chunqing dared not delay , and he hurriedly made the long journey to his hometown , qinglong , because his home was in qinglong .
at the time ran guangqi was serving as qinglong county secretary and county head .
after receiving wang chunqing 's report , ran guangqi immediately convened the county 's standing committee to discuss the earthquake situation .
at that time , with the upper levels of government not having issued any earthquake prediction , it was he that faced the risk of losing his position and on july 25 made a decision , that he had to notify everyone of the earthquake situation before july 26 .
from that moment , all of qinglong county went into pre-earthquake mode .
after learning of this , what was ran guangqi , as county secretary and county head , thinking and doing ?
we had to take the initiative in this .
uh , the wolf came , and whose child did he carry off ?
it 's the lives of 470,000 people , is n't it ?
is n't it ?
the worst case scenario would be losing -lrb- his -rrb- office !
it did not matter .
right . that was one thing .
the second thing was , criticizing deng .
criticizing deng , we could put it that way the serious matter of criticizing deng , we did n't dare not to do , because that was a call from above !
right ! a call from above , they were calling on us to criticize deng , so we criticized deng .
but we were talking to the ordinary people , and there 's no difference between criticizing at home and criticizing in the courtyard .
what 's the difference ? we were out trying to do earthquake prevention , so we just went on criticizing deng outside !
our supervisors checked up on us and learned that we were outside criticizing deng .
that was one problem , they were thinking like that .
ha , the third thing was , we were really dealing with a major quake .
if there 's no quake , the ordinary people will just see that we 're imperfect .
the mosquito sees a few welts and comes back again , right ?
the ordinary people will call us a few bad names , when it becomes worse , we bow and leave the stage .
but if we did n't issue an earthquake prediction and there was a real earthquake , we 'd be embarrassed in front of the locals .
maybe you do n't acknowledge the debt , but you 'd feel bad about it .
ran guangqi examined the matter thoroughly , and under these circumstances he was decisive and issued an earthquake prediction , and he did n't tell anyone he was doing it . so basically it was not recorded at the province level .
so i issued the prediction .
if there was no earthquake , that 's fine , at worst i 'd lose my position .
other people had black gauze caps , and they looked at them as black gauze caps i had a black gauze cap , and i treated it as a stupid turtle . that 's the original saying .
on november 8 , 1976 , the national seismology bureau released its seventeenth seismic report .
the report said that the tangshan earthquake had damaged 180,000 homes in qinglong county , with 7,300 of these collapsing , but only one person had died as a direct result of the earthquake .
the kailuan mine bureau was another miracle .
the miracle was that 10,000 miners working in kailuan mine bureau mines successfully escaped danger in the great tangshan earthquake , and this established a model for disaster prevention and preparation .
perhaps there are more lessons to be learned from kailuan than from qinglong .
with seismologists being unable to set a date for an imminent earthquake , how can people carry out effective disaster prevention and preparation work ?
when the great tangshan earthquake hit , why was it that the kailuan mine was able to keep the mortality rate at only 0.07 % ?
i went down in the mines once , and i thought about this , under those circumstances , their miners , if a real earthquake hits , if they do n't get them out of there very quickly , that 's a horrendous thing .
why ?
this , in a mine , if the power goes out , the power goes out and there 's no ventilation .
if the power goes out and the ventilation stops , in 40 minutes or so , the gas , uh , gas , underground flooding , uh , that can quickly threaten human life .
-lrb- power -rrb- outage , -lrb- ventilation -lrb- stop , if the power goes out and the ventilation stops for more than forty minutes , so everything has to be done in that time frame .
otherwise , it 's very difficult to ensure their life safety .
before the great tangshan earthquake , the kailuan mine bureau did a lot of work to establish feasible measures to ensure that underground miners safely escape dangers .
the kailuan mine bureau set up an earthquake preparedness leadership group , organized at various levels , right .
what employees in critical departments were supposed to do , right , what the leaders in critical departments were supposed to do , it was all clearly spelled out .
in this document . it 's all clearly spelled out .
so when the big earthquake was near , they did n't panic , they were able to bring the miners back up safely .
so only seven men died .
the kailuan mine bureau , following the principle that it is better to have a thousand days without an earthquake than one day of unpreparedness , and based on the idea that there will be an earthquake , a large earthquake , and soon , constantly focused on underground earthquake - proofing work .
moreover , they did n't stop with written earthquake preparedness measures they transferred a lot of human and physical resources to carry out shoring - up and maintenance work aboveground and underground .
so in terms of the kailuan mine bureau , they certainly did n't pin all their hopes on someone issuing an earthquake forecast .
what they did pin their hopes on was , i do n't care what day the earthquake occurs on , i 'm not afraid .
every day they said , maybe they said , taking this whatchamacallit , i mean .
it 's like they said , they were kind of thinking , let 's maintain this army for a thousand days even if we only use it for one hour .
i , every , every day you have an earthquake and i 'm still , the , i just do what i 'm supposed to do .
what do i mean when i say i just do what i 'm supposed to do ?
from %pw , on the day they established the earthquake office , they began paying attention to earthquake forecasting .
their focus on earthquake forecasting was , i mean , whenever the earthquake hits , the kailuan mine bureau says we have to assure the miners underground .
it 's no good if we ca n't , get them back up , get the miners back up .
when the great tangshan earthquake hit , the kailuan mine bureau was situated in the extreme quake zone .
eight mines and one under construction were all in the 9 to 11 intensity zone .
more than 70 % of the buildings collapsed or were seriously damaged the power grid , the transport system and mineshaft elevators , ventilation and drainage facilities were severely damaged .
at the time , about half the kailuan miners were stuck underground .
in the moment that the earthquake hit , how could they be gotten out ?
at the time , how to get them out , according to their , this , at the time , this involved several problems , very typical ones .
um , for example , the lu jiatuo mine , lu jiatuo , the lu jiatuo mine , the lu jiatuo mine had a vertical - shaft ladder , and at the time there were more than a thousand people in the mine , male , female , old and young .
at the time it seemed like , the mine 's deputy manager , jia bangyou , he was very calmly commanding over a thousand people , keeping them not panicked .
first thing was avoiding panic , at every level , whatever responsibility was to be shouldered , you had to shoulder it , we just spoke about that , so there was a clear division of labor .
more than a thousand people , you can imagine if there was n't excellent organization , a few would get trampled .
i was thinking , a few will get trampled .
at the time , jia bangyou said , go to a station at the mine 's mouth , women comrades come up first .
after all the women comrades had gone up , the new workers went up .
there were regulations , they , they had it in the document in writing , new workers go up .
after the new workers had all gone up , the experienced older workers went up .
finally , the ccp members came up last , and at the time jia bangyou said , ccp members come up last .
at the mouth of the mine , the people who had come up first did n't leave , they stayed right there , enduring the aftershocks , and they waited right through to past 8:00 a.m. .
jia bangyou finally came back up to the surface safely .
not one of the lu jiatuo mine 's underground personnel had been lost more than a thousand people escaped death deep underground in this dangerous situation .
they created an inspiring miracle underground , but it was not by accident .
i really admire this group of ccp members who were at the lu jiatuo mine in 1976 .
the ccp members who were at the lu jiatuo mine in 1976 were the last to come up .
uh , after they had come up , no one at the mouth of the mine had left .
why ?
their mine boss , jia bangyou , had not yet come up .
men , women , old and young were all at the mouth of the mine , not going anywhere .
jia bangyou came up , took a look at the crowd , all waiting there quietly , and he was very moved at that time .
he said , go on ! all of you go home ! go see whether your families are still alive .
!
qinglong county successfully issued the imminent earthquake warning , and 470,000 people in the entire county got through the disaster unscathed .
the kailuan mine bureau has lost only seven out of 10,000 of its mine workers , which is a miracle of disaster preparedness .
and in the final analysis their success was manifested in their focusing on earthquakes .
possibly we should say , if , before the quake , the relevant national departments had taken seriously the news of the earthquake forecast , would the casualties have been so high ?
if it had been , it would n't have been such a tragedy .
there simply would n't have been such a tragedy . if there had been communication at all levels , and the people of tangshan had been warned . uh , even if you do n't have a definite date .
you ca n't determine july 28 at 3:42 , that 's impossible .
but there 's an approximate time frame , when the relatively big earthquake will probably occur , and that kind of a notice ought to be given out .
and what exactly do you think was the reason that this was n't done ?
the precise reason it was n't done , you could say there were many factors involved .
but the main factor , i believe , is that it was n't taken seriously enough at the time , it was n't taken seriously enough .
even though the tangshan seismic monitoring network had so many , so many earthquake warning signs , uh ,
every province and city has so many emergency reporting offices , look at tianjin , beijing , hebei , they all have emergency reporting stations .
it %pw , they all had earthquake forecast opinions , but they did n't attract enough attention .
when you did your investigation , and you discovered that at the time china 's level was such as to be able to predict this earthquake , what did you think ?
how can i explain this ?
in earthquake forecasting , success means succeeding in your probing of the situation , and failure means failing in your probing .
to date i still do n't feel , i mean , the national seismology bureau should have predicted this earthquake coming .
rather , it 's in the , the attitudes of some of the officials of the national seismology bureau .
for example , you , you take seriously , you come , your underlings forcefully request a meeting , you meet with them and you do it .
if you ca n't make a decision , it 's a matter of your level .
some of our officials are n't --
this is also an issue that perplexes a lot of people , why is it that the masses ' community monitoring stations can pick up abnormal data , but the specialists , the experts , do n't detect anything ?
all i can say is , this is the sadness of 240,000 wronged souls of tangshan .
really .
the local people all saw it coming .
this book of mine , uh , the title page i write , i wrote this for the people of the tangshan earthquake monitoring network i respectfully represent the 240,000 dead .
i really wrote that i represented the dead , i do n't represent the living .
i respectfully represent the 240,000 tangshan dead , and (pp-clr-tpc-1 (in to the people of the former tansghan monitoring , earthquake monitoring network , you predicted the great tangshan earthquake , you reported the emergency , you made every effort .
you are the pride of the people of your home town !
we love you ! and we pray for you !
in your view , is it more important to maintain social stability in the region around the capital , or is it more important that a major earthquake may cost the lives of many people ?
in my view , in my view , of course it 's human life , definitely more important than anything else , that is my final appeal in my book .
my appeal , one , this one , this one little crux .
life is more important than anything else !
regardless whether you 're , any country , any region , any race , any political party , people 's dignity , people 's lives are more important than anything else .
this has always been the pain in the hearts of many chinese seismologists .
before the great tangshan earthquake , china had medium - long - range forecasts , it had annual forecasts , it had imminent forecasts . but in the end , the tragic result was that 240,000 people lost their lives .
we should say there is a profound lesson in this .
why do you believe that the leaders involved need to take responsibility for this ?
maybe for them it was just an inadvertent mistake , or an oversight .
i believe they ought to , the , have held a meeting , and maybe reduced the losses .
therefore the tangshan earthquake , i still say , we are not at the levels , to forecast , to forecast on time , on july 28 , 1976 , at approximately 3:42 .
but we are at the level where we can say , in late july or early august , in that week of time ,
we , this all could have been said .
we 're not at the level to report that tangshan city , the small area of fengnan in tangshan , but we can report for the beijing , tianjin , tangshan and zhangjiakou area .
this has already , we have already , very clearly said that .
we ca n't correctly predict a 7.8 earthquake , but we can forecast an above 5.0 , even above 6.0 , or even that not excluding a 7.0 earthquake , that we can say .
if you look at the tangshan disaster records , many people might get the impression that the great tangshan earthquake was not just a natural disaster , but that it was made up of many human disasters . how do you see that ?
that was %pw , you just asked me , i , it 's a question i ca n't answer clearly here , i mean , to be precise , it 's , in addition to a natural disaster it 's also a human disaster .
that included at the time , the , in terms of politics , certainly some campaigns like the gang of four had , had an effect , that , that , that 's one thing .
but (adjp-prd-tpc-2 (rbr more important is that we , some , i mean , people who are responsible for the earthquake - related decision - making , they did n't do their duty and their responsibility to their utmost .
the price paid for the great tangshan earthquake was 240,000 lives tragically lost , and that will forever be part of history ; what lessons should mankind learn from this great disaster ?
can the tragedy of the great tangshan earthquake ever be repeated ?
what is even more unexpected is that two chinese seismologists who precisely predicted the tangshan quake and who have spent a lifetime doing earthquake research coincidentally believe that china has not made progress in earthquake forecasting levels , but has actually gone backwards .
if the thing were to happen again today , happen in today 's china , do you think disaster could be avoided ?
now it could not be avoided , now china does n't have , uh , this capacity .
so in terms of china , it does n't have this capacity .
in today 's china the level of earthquake forecasting , i believe , compared to before the tangshan earthquake , has fallen , has slipped by a wide margin .
if we were once again to continue focusing on earthquake preparedness as before premier zhou died , with the policy of the experts and the masses working together , and combining chinese and foreign methods , then , earthquake forecasting would be on the right track again .
now we 're missing , out of two legs , missing one leg .
experts and the masses working together , with the masses monitoring and working on preparedness , it 's all weak , been weakened .
and that 's very disturbing .
looking at it in terms of the great tangshan earthquake , monitoring and preparedness by the masses and monitoring of ground stress have already been proven ; they should be effective , so why are n't they being taken seriously ?
but that ca n't be , it 's , the seismology bureau system says , uh , acknowledges , oh !
in the %pw , '80s , exactly which year i 'm not sure , a conference was held in quanzhou , we who believe in monitoring and preparedness by the masses call it the three earths , earth electricity , earth stress , and earth magnetism , they denied it all .
i say the method of monitoring and preparedness by the masses used before the tangshan quake , and methods that produced this prediction .
and also before an earthquake in coastal cities , the method of monitoring and preparedness by the masses , in

children are left at home in the rural areas , after parents leave to work in the city .
these are called left - behind children .
the parents are also forced to work in the city . in fact , they have no alternatives but to make such a decision .
there are 120 million farmers who work in the city all year round in china , thus creating nearly 20 million left - behind children .
i want to tell them that i miss them a lot .
day after day and year after year , they long for love in loneliness and wait for family affection in defect .
i think that it is especially important to have emotional exchanges with the children .
visit the children more often whenever possible .
-lsb- -rsb-
in september 2005 , a study report titled (`` " concern for left - behind children had drawn wide public attention .
while the situation of peasant workers in the city has repeatedly put society into question , the phenomenon of left - behind children in rural areas has gradually entered the view of the public .
ye jingzhong is the assistant dean of the college of humanities and development at china agricultural university , and team leader of the left - behind children task force .
in the last two years , he has led the task force to conduct many field interviews and investigations on left - behind children in numerous rural areas in central and western china , including shaanxi , ningxia , hebei , and beijing .
why did you pick the central and western parts of china , and not the south , to conduct this study ?
first of all , for people who work in the city from the central and western regions um , uh , according to their educational level , they generally engage in strenuous manual labor when they leave for the city to work .
they are not in a position to bring their children to the city .
when we conducted this research study , our focus was to analyze the impact on children when their parents work in the city , work in the city .
its impact , its main impact is the lack of love because of the absence of their parents .
therefore , we believe that whether it 's in southern or northern part , no matter which part of the country the research is conducted in , the results should be consistent .
according to your estimation , how many left - behind children are there in china now ?
this group should be the biggest in number .
um , the most conservative statistics for the group of people who leave the country to work in the city in our country is 100 million .
nowadays , um , many , um , many places , um , cite a figure of 120 million .
many people quote a figure of 150 million .
let 's think about it this way . if we actually use 120 million as the statistic for the group who leave the country to work in the city , at least half , at least half of them are um , married before they work in the city .
of course , families of these married people will usually have children .
moreover , they will usually have more than one child in rural areas .
so you can imagine . i believe the left - behind children group is definitely more than 10 or 20 million . it should be , uh , should be , in my opinion , should be around 50 million .
of course , we have not conducted exact statistical calculations . i believe the number of this group should be particularly large .
according to the study by the task force , at present , the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody , skip - generation custody , relative custody , and same - generation custody . among which , single - parent custody had the highest number , accounting for 79.2 percent of the people surveyed .
the next one was skip - generation custody , accounting for 16.9 percent . while those who lived with relatives or were entrusted to the care of someone else made up 4.1 percent and .9 percent of the total number of left - behind children , respectively .
according to your study , what do these left - behind children generally do with their daily life if their parents or parent work in the city ?
different types of custody have different impacts on their life .
no doubt , the less impact , single - parent custody definitely creates less impact compared to the other types .
the impact of single - parent custody is smaller because at least the mother is at home .
there is no major problem in the children 's material life . of course , there are many impacts in other aspects , for instance , peer socialization .
the one that creates a huge impact is definitely skip - generation custody .
skip - generation custody means the grandparents look after the children .
there is also relative or neighbor custody that asks neighbors or relatives to look after the children , and there is a type called self - custody .
these three types create the biggest and the most impact .
if we want to discuss this in more detail , let 's say , the skip - generation custody .
first , in skip - generation custody , their material life will no doubt be a lot less taken care of when compared to the usual both parents or one parent at home situation .
this is indisputable . this type of family is not as good as the others . we had an example of a child in shaanxi province . um , was a family !
this family had an older brother and a younger sister . both parents wanted to go to the city to work .
the father went first , and later the mother wanted to go , too . what happened to these two children ?
the grandparents were unwilling to take care of them because in rural areas , grandparents also have to work in the field !
as a result , this , this , this mother sent these , these , these brother and sister to martial arts school , to martial arts school to study .
after they went to the martial arts school for a while , um , their mother was , um , a little worried , so she went to visit them .
she went to visit them . when she saw them , the , the girl cried to her and said , (`` " i really do n't want to stay here . i want to go home .
later , the mother was moved and brought this , this , this girl home and had the grandparents look after her .
um , she still left the boy at home , ai , left him at the martial arts school .
um , um , after the girl returned , the mother continued to work in the city .
when she came back one time in between work , she found that the girl 's body was dotted with red marks and red swellings . she then discovered ah , um , the grandparents had not washed her clothes for a very long time .
the situation you mentioned , is it common or is it a rather extreme example , because generally , people will think that grandparents will particularly love and care about their grandchildren ?
the situation that i just mentioned regarding skip - generation custody is no doubt common .
why is it so ?
you said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children .
it is true . it is true that they will go out of their way to pamper the children .
however , for the elderly , with the difference in age and time , their , their , their , ways of taking care and loving the children are different .
they are influenced by their own habits .
for instance , there was a child who was sick . um , the grandparents asked him to take a , a small pill that was made in shaanxi . they did not even know what it was made of . it was a local method .
um , after all , they are different from , um , young people in this respect . instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible , they are influenced by some , some habits in this aspect .
they , they raised this point themselves .
another important point they mentioned was that they had to take care of the entire family .
(`` " her father and mother are not home , so the entire family falls onto our shoulders , especially when we still have to be responsible for the farm work on the farmland .
so , all i can do is to feed her and make sure that she is not cold .
they also had to face such a reality , one that they could not resolve .
after all , a family that had so many people in the beginning , the parents were , the parents of the children were a very important um , workforce . now it was down to the two grandparents . no doubt , they could not help .
in the study of left - behind children , many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city , and the inculcation and upbringing cycle of their children , have formed two parallel lines that will never meet .
farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime , while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school .
originally , they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education . however , adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more .
during this period , the absence of both or even one parent will create obstacles to the character development of the children .
this pair of unavoidable contradictions has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious .
you have seen many kinds of left - behind children . was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ?
there was a child in ningxia , um , there was a child in ningxia whose name was yao zhengang .
this child , um , did not do exceptionally well in school .
what impressed me the most about him was that he really missed his parents . he felt particularly lonely and especially wanted his father to come back .
he said that he was sick one time . his father worked in guyuan , about 40 to 50 kilometers away from home .
after his father learned that he was very sick , he ran back to the village right away .
after he arrived at the village , he did not say anything , but to put him on his back and carry him to the town to see a doctor .
he just carried him like that without saying a word .
when the doctor in the town took a look and told him that they were unable to cure the sickness , he carried the child to the county .
when yao zhengang told us what happened , he said , (`` " my father had never bought me so many tasty foods before . on that day , he bought me a lot of tasty food while we were in the county , but he did not eat any himself .
i thought about this at that time . after i heard this incident , i particularly understood what was in the mind of yao zhengang 's father .
he might have felt especially guilty toward his child .
what he felt was that i go out to work and leave my child home . he said that his child had also said , (`` " when he was at home , he always encouraged me . he would say , (`` " no problem . you work hard and get a better grade next time , when i had low grades .
if he could receive many such , such encouragements , he would not have um , um , disliked school sometimes . he does not want to go to school now .
however , in his example , i could imagine what went through his father 's mind at that time . i think that he felt very guilty toward his child .
therefore , i can feel that um , um , parents who work in the city also have no alternative . they are forced into making such decisions .
um , there was also this child . there was a child , a girl in xixiang county , shaanxi province .
um , when i asked , (`` " what do you think are the changes that your parents working in the city have caused you ? she did not answer .
she went home to get a small box . there was a small finger inside the box .
this was a very terrifying incident . what was the small finger all about ?
what happened was that when her um , parents left to work in the city , her grandparents looked after her .
they had a cellar at home and (advp-loc-tpc-1 (rb inside was a hay cutter for cutting hay .
when she went downstairs to play by herself , an accident happened .
her grandparents said , (`` " we ca n't help . we ca n't keep an eye on her all the time .
her parents , um , went , before they went to work in the city , they could watch her and forbade her to go down to the cellar .
he had told her not to do that before . however , i said that sometimes it is very difficult to ask children to have self control . that was why she turned this way .

this is ruangang village , bocang town , yi county , hebei province .
among the 303 households in the village , one - third of the families have people who work in the city .
more than half of the children in the village are left - behind children .
most of the children 's parents are in the southern part of the country .
many people want to save some travel expenses and earn some more money , so it is very common for them not to return home for a year or two .
life is so vast . life is an ocean wherever life exists .
it has been six years since 14 - year - old jiang beiwen was sent by his parents to live with his maternal grandfather in ruangang village .
his parents rely on selling rice in guangzhou to support their child 's education . they live a very hard life . little beiwen has not seen them once in the past six years .
oh , i see so many children here who can turn for comfort in their parents ' arms ! ah , i envy them .
so , i also want to , want to be able to turn to comfort in my parents ' arms .
i was at school the time i missed my mother the most . uh huh .
we had a market ! oh , every day , there were parents who bought things for their oh , sons and daughters .
i also wish that my parents could buy me things . i envied them very much . that was when i missed my mother the most .
this is jiang beiwen 's favorite photo . (np-sbj-tpc-1 (prp it was taken with his father six years ago , before he sent him to live with his maternal grandfather .
he was only eight years old at that time .
the only connection that little beiwen has with his parents now is to talk on the phone with them once a week .
in his opinion , affection among family members is something unreachable .
how often can your mother call you ?
uh , once a week !
what do you talk about ?
i will talk about my studies and life .
my schoolwork was not quite good when i first came !
my mother scolded me in the beginning when my schoolwork was poor .
she said that i was losing honor for not doing well at school ! then i cried and after that , my mother cried , too .
since they move from place to place in the city to work all year round , parents of left - behind children have little communication with their children .
while for temporary custodians , they are only limited to providing superficial care , such as making sure the children have food and stay warm , but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating the children .
the survey found that 36.7 percent of the children had never been to their parents ' workplace .
8.2 percent of the parents almost never contacted their children .
21.4 percent of the parents contacted their children less than once a month .
since their parents are absent , how can these children communicate and exchange with their parents ?
our study found that um , um , the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone .
however , contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called , approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so .
what could they talk about in three minutes ?
i think it is hard to say anything meaningful in three minutes .
of course , we also studied what these children talked to their parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations .
what did the parents who worked in the city talk about with their children ?
what touched us very deeply was that 70 percent of the content of the children 's conversations with their parents was to ask about their safety and not other things , such as how much they had earned .
as for the content of the parents ' conversations with their children , first , it was school .
whether they were good and how their schoolwork was .
second , it was whether they obeyed their custodians and what they ate and things like that . uh , as for safety matters , in fact , they could not have any emotional exchange .
we know that sometimes when we talk on the phone , even a pause is a need for emotional exchange . however , the parents may not have realized this . for instance , the child has stopped talking .
he stops talking because he needs to pause to consider how to say what is in his mind .
the parents may not have realized this point , so they hang up the phone immediately . of course , for three minutes , why was it only for three minutes ? in many cases , it was because they worried about the charge .
these left - behind children , many left - behind children told us that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone . however , um , they considered that um , one thing , sometimes they did not have a telephone at home . it was very difficult for children to borrow the phone from their neighbors .
second , um , they considered that they needed money to make a phone call . some children told me , (`` " i secretly called my parents when my custodians were not home .
the children have a great need for this type of telephone exchange .
do the left - behind children understand why their parents work in the city ?
um , um , we conducted a survey on this question . we were very surprised to find that 40 percent of the left - behind children had no idea what jobs their parents held away from home .
how could that be possible ?
how could that be possible ? we interviewed some left - behind children , their custodians , and the people who work in the city .
why would n't the children know what they did ?
first , we can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of the parents who work in the city .
however , a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work , including coalmines , construction , and some others , many of them are dangerous jobs .
thus , i believe the parents of these left - behind children also choose not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of their job .
why do they do that ? it is because they are afraid that their children will worry .
second , parents , parents , especially fathers , who work in the city have a particularly lofty image in the children 's mind .
maybe they do not want their children to know about the nature of their job or tell them what they do .
they do not want , do not want to destroy the lofty image of themselves in the child 's mind .
at noon , the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather went to work in the field and did not come home .
jiang beiwen has to make lunch for himself . this happens to him very often .
he could look after himself since he was nine .
what work are you going to do today , other than cooking ?
uh , i will do the dishes after i finish eating .
if it is sunday when i am free , i will also help , also do some farm work .
what kind of work ?
uh , i will hoe the field , uh , when we are in a hurry to till the land for growing crops , i will help do some work .
do you still remember your mother 's cooking ?
uh huh , i do .
it was especially tasty .
now , the most i want to know is my father 's , my parents ' health .
why do you want to know about that ?
it is because i care about my parents very much .
i think about their work because i know that they work in the city because of me , so i care about them a lot .
they will be worn out from working in the city , working in the city to make money .
i believe it is also because of me , so i care about their health a lot .
because of you , why is it because of you ?
because if they did n't have me , i think they uh , would be a lot more %pw , relaxed when they worked .
then , are these children willing to live with their parents ? or go to the city with them ?
in regard to this , first , father , children all want their parents to come back to live with them .
however , 51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to the city with their parents , go to the city , to live in the city .
however , they all wanted their parents to come back , but half of the children did not want to go to the city .
we also asked them why they did not want to go to the city .
this was also very surprising to us .
they said that the city is another world and they were especially worried .
they were afraid that once they go to the city , they will not be able to assimilate into the schools and things like that .
second , they realized that it is already a very difficult task for their parents to work in the city .
their parents have to send money home , among other things . if they go live with them , they will add more burdens to their parents .
if we are in the city every day , live in the city every day , we may know that oh , city life is like this .
as for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in the city , they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear .
as for parents , are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ?
i believe when parents make this decision , their main consideration is not willing or unwilling .
all parents , i can say the majority of the parents , definitely want to live with their children .
however , with the reality that they have to face , i believe that they can not solve this problem . of course , we know what the reality is .
first , their families are rather poor to begin with . only the lower - middle class will leave the rural areas and work in the city .
they have to make money to support the family .
they will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city .
nonetheless , i believe there are also many other reasons . they also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city . they have to find a place to live . all these are problems that they need to resolve .
the problems they face are too many .
if the children go to the city , the expenses will be very high .
since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or their psychological need . many parents are unable to bring their children with them .
what would you tell your parents if you could see them now ?
i want to tell them that i miss them very much .
judging from the surface , is there any obvious difference between the character of these left - behind children and non-left - behind children ?
it is hard to tell from the surface . why is it so ?
for these children , it depends on how long their parents have been working in the city . for example , some have just gone for a year , while others have gone for 10 years already .
in this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect .
however , many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn .
they had very strange um , um , temperaments . they did not like to speak .
there was a , a child who was in the first year of junior high school .
um , um , he told us himself that he particularly , um , um , misses his father .
he was very good at school .
however , one time we visited him , his um , family told us that he was second in his class in his examination . after that , he became extremely , extremely , annoyed . um , um , um , his language and other things became very strange .
um , um , we also asked his um , um , grandparents who had custody of him .
they said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him . um , of course , it was not necessarily because his parents worked in the city .
however , for some left - behind children , their parents working in the city has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development . this situation indeed exists .
after all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete .
i believe love is especially important . children need love from the time they are small . we have to understand our chinese saying , (`` " the child is father to the man .
what it says is that the character that children form at a very young age will affect their entire life .
only children who are loved and who realize the importance of love since they are young will be able to love other people in the future .
this is the case .
therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychologically , they do not have family love .
um , if the parents , not , if the parents work in the city , these children perhaps will not receive timely attention when they encounter many difficulties at home . perhaps the neighbors around are all facing different realities and can not offer them timely love .
under this situation , i believe , i am not sure , um , i am unwilling to imagine what mentality and character these children will develop when they grow up .
will they believe there is love in society or not ?
will they think that love is important in society or not , because they have never experienced it . they have never completely experienced it .
thus , if such a large group in society does not realize that love should be , um , given or received in society , i think this is a very , something that i do not want to imagine .
despite the guarantee in food , clothing , and school that left - behind children get because their parents work in the city to make money , they do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that they require .
according to the survey , more than half of the left - behind children were dissatisfied with their current life .
58 percent of the left - behind children believed that they were unhappy .
are the parents worried about leaving their children at home by themselves ? do they understand the living conditions of their children at home ?
they thought that this was a reality that they could not um , um , face . they were condemned to this reality .
no doubt , i think some , um , parents have not had such profound consideration . why do n't they ?
i believe people are all the same . if they face such an urgent need for a livelihood , their first consideration will be the need for a livelihood .
they can not consider the deeper issue of children 's safety and psychology when their livelihood has not been solved , satisfied , and guaranteed .
for example , there were two sisters who lived in a cave dwelling in shaanxi province .
many people whom we interviewed lived in cave dwellings .
once there was a flood . these , these sisters stayed in the cave dwelling to look after the home !
this happened in the rural area . these two children were looking after the home .
their uncle saved them when the flood was almost past their bellies .
their father called later to see if they were fine .
the family told him that they were fine . he did not come back after that .
he did not come back to check if everything was fine .
i believe the reason he did not return was that he would ponder whether he should return or not .
in the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major hong kong media .
with their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused hong kong to be a focus of worldwide attention .
the world 's fifth disney park will soon open to the public here .
the most important thing about disney is that it is a global brand .
well , for several years , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed hong kong with new respect .
then welcome to the official writing ceremony of hong kong disneyland .
the construction of hong kong disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 .
in january of that year , the hong kong government turned over to disney corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of lantau island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .
one .
since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in hong kong .
as its neighbor on lantau island , hong kong international airport had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .
mickey mouse 's new home , settling on chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention .
there 's only one month left before the opening of hong kong disneyland on september 12 .
the subway to disney has already been constructed .
at subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens .
meanwhile , the disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park .
for two years , disney has constantly maintained its mystery .
no media have been allowed to enter for photos .
we took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward disney , trying to experience this mysterious park from close by .
however , before any of the disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards disney .
on our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .
er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially opened , opened , all , no cars can enter unless they have special permission .
no one can enter otherwise .
video recording is especially forbidden .
ah , everything is top secret .
if pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .
although disney corporation chose hong kong as the venue for the chinese disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland china tourist market .
since the implementation of the individual visit scheme between hong kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit hong kong .
from the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists have , have come to hong kong .
well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .
at this point , it has been about two years .
also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .
hong kong was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today 's international metropolis .
here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .
when in hong kong , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in mong kok .
you can go to burn incense and make a vow at the repulse bay , where all deities gather .
you can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in hong kong .
you can ascend victoria peak to get a panoramic view of victoria harbor 's beautiful scenery .
or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .
after dark , cruise victoria harbor at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .
every corner of hong kong is filled with fun .
meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the hong kong tourism industry bring us ?
over the past 28 years , the ocean park has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to hong kong .
watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the ocean theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .
or ride the giant ferris wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of hong kong island and the south china sea .
these items , which were the pride of the ocean park , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in hong kong for some time .
however , since disney entered hong kong , the ocean park , sharing the same city as disney , has felt the pressure of competition .
to improve the park 's brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .
it seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
that is , the entire park will be divided into seven sections for renovation .
ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .
it seems that those attractions like the north pole and the marine life center will also be renovated after several years .
are they going to be different from what they are now ?
they will be , in ten years .
ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .
it looks like we will also bring in whales .
er , we will implement this plan as soon as it is approved by the government .
groundbreaking is expected to start next year .
yes .
the area of hong kong is only one thousand - plus square kilometers .
the population is dense .
natural resources are relatively scarce .
however , the clever hong kong people will utilize all resources they have created for developing the hong kong tourism industry .
(pp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (in among these is the avenue of stars .
entering hollywood of the east ,
here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .
he is my .
she is my goddess , ah .
please stay with us on new world travel .
hong kong has always worn the crown of hollywood of the east .
over the past 100 years of film history , hong kong cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .
they have shortened the distance between hong kong and the world .
hong kong movies have even become a window for the world to see hong kong , which have made the image of metropolitan hong kong more prominent internationally .
for this reason , in 2004 , on the waterfront promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of hong kong island and victoria harbor , the hong kong tourism board also constructed the avenue of stars , memorializing hong kong 's 100 - year film history .
here , tourists can learn about hong kong 's film history , and can come up close with the stars in their mind .
hong kong is a busy metropolis .
even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stops beating .
across from the avenue of stars , a special performance is staged every weekend .
%pw as our victoria harbor is %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
so , one idea was to transform victoria harbor into a performance stage .
er , each key building is like a performer .
it is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .
let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .
the pla hong kong garrison plaza , bank of china tower , at 8:00 every saturday night , hsbc main building .
their performances will be on schedule .
center of the east central .
ten landmark buildings located on hong kong island reveal themselves one by one , participating in the show in full splendor , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .
whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .
some , er , cities have consulted with us .
uh-huh .
their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .
yes .
the answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building 's reward .
er , of course , after sars , we felt that all of hong kong hopes to be involved , so that the hong kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .
hong kong wetland park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the hong kong sar government for advancing the hong kong tourism industry .
this is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the hong kong government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .
hong kong wetland park covers an area of 61 hectares , including a 10,000 square meter visitor 's center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .
in the indoor exhibition hall , tourists can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .
outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology .
at the highest point of hong kong , er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .
ha , that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,
but me is our wetland park .
ha , entirely different .
quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , the wetland park exploration center .
lastly , farthest away you can see putian of shenzhen .
then , the bridge is , the bridge is hong kong and (advp-loc-prd-tpc-2 (rb outside is shenzhen .
you can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .
children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our daily life .
(pp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (in over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .
ha , there are aquatic plants inside .
ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many hong kong children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .
look over there . they are going to be ripe soon .
the long one over there .
oh .
yes .
with , with ears , ah .
where ?
ah , here .
perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when they see them .
let , let them get some understanding .
mai po marshes adjacent to wetland park is a major wildlife habitat within asia .
each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over hong kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .
as a result , three different types of aviaries were built in hong kong wetland park .
these have become the best spots to observe birds .
among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .
it is an endangered bird species throughout the world .
uh-huh .
ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world .
wow .
um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to hong kong to spend the winter .
some of them , er , have stayed in hong kong wetland park .
uh-huh .
so , our park 's logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention .
uh-huh .
wetland park workers are now in the middle of intensive work .
they will complete the park 's entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 discover hong kong year campaign .
ah , we have established the year 2006 as discover hong kong year .
why is that ?
because , as everyone knows , our disneyland will open in september of this year .
in addition , we will have ngong ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the giant buddha .
they add to what we already have , like the avenue of stars , which is also very famous .
moreover , er , we are including our software .
hong kong 's software is very well known .
like what 's used in our symphony of lights .
we hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 discover hong kong year .
without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .
a dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .
because your line connects us with two --
in recent years , hong kong 's tourist attractions have gradually moved from hong kong island to kowloon and the new territory .
two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 discover hong kong year are located on lantau island of the new territory .
for this reason , lantau island has become a new hong kong tourism popular spot .
the earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze buddha .
in chinese buddhism , there are five directions east , west , south , north , and center and five buddhas .
therefore , hong kong 's tian tan giant buddha at the most southern tip of china , together with lingshan giant buddha in the east , leshan giant buddha in the west , yungang giant buddha in the north , and longmen giant buddha in the central plains , exist as the representative buddhas for each of the five directions of china .
as a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .
however , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .
since this giant bronze buddha settled on lantau island , the world renowned hong kong international airport at chek lap kok and disneyland have also been constructed here in succession .
the important status of lantau island is increasingly apparent .
no , it was totally inaccessible in the past .
in the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting hong kong , zhuhai , and macao .
in 1992 --
could n't go in summer --
so , after their return , macao , and hong kong , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .
it 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
one has to go up to shenzhen , dongguan , then go through panyu , keep going up , to zhongshan , and certainly go to zhuhai , then pass through zhuhai to get to macao .
for a hong kong person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
a full twenty years ago , hopewell holdings group chairman wu ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal .
with this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .
however , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .
this is what we have seen since 1999 .
anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .
well , originally the construction of the new --
with this new hong kong - zhuhai - macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , hong kong , macao , and zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
macao is this way , and zhuhai is this way .
from the perspective of either hong kong , macao , or zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone .
er , %pw zhuhai for sightseeing tours , macao for entertainment , and we have disneyland and other , other attractions in hong kong .
each place has different attractions of its own .
so , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland china or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .
once the zhuhai - hong kong - macao bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in macao before having fun at disneyland just an hour later .
promotion of hong kong disneyland has long since begun .
however , even though it has entered the last countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
ah , currently it has been decided that disney will open on september 12 .
there 's also what we call soft opening .
ah , they are now rehearsing .
ah , different , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in september .
well , i am very confident , that when our tourists come to disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfied .
the wonder tour will start from hong kong .
this dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .
it continues to explore ; it continues to open new worlds .
each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .
hong kong is a world famous shopping paradise .

we respectfully invite you to watch a special edition of across china .
ww ii landmarks on the great earth of china : eternal memories of taihang mountain
standing tall on taihang mountain is the monument to the hundred regiments offensive .
it is composed of a primary stele , secondary steles , a huge round sculpture and beacon tower , and the great wall , among other things .
a primary stele , three secondary steles , and two inscribed steles .
the hundred regiments offensive was the campaign of the largest scale launched by the eighth route army during the war of resistance against japan .
this campaign broke through the japanese army 's blockade to reach base areas behind enemy lines , stirring up anti-japanese spirit throughout the nation and influencing the situation of the anti-fascist war of the people worldwide .
this is zhuanbi village , wuxiang county of shanxi province , where the eighth route army was headquartered back then .
on a wall outside the headquarters we found a map . this map was the eighth route army 's depiction of the mediterranean sea situation at that time .
this map reflected the european battlefield situation .
in 1940 , the german army invaded and occupied czechoslovakia , poland , the netherlands , belgium , and france .
it was during this year that the japanese army developed a strategy to rapidly force the chinese people into submission by the end of 1940 .
in may , the japanese army launched --
from one side , it seized an important city in china called yichang .
um , yichang , uh , through yichang , it could directly reach chongqing .
ah , that threatened chongqing .
then they would , ah , bomb these large rear areas such as chongqing .
so , along with the coordinated , er , economic blockade , military offensives , and strategic bombings , er , a simultaneous attack was launched in hong kong to lure the kmt government into surrender .
the progress of this coordinated offensive was already very entrenched by then .
by 1940 , china 's war of resistance against japan had entered a stalemate .
the situation on our side and the enemy 's side was intertwined .
the eighth route army guerrillas were extraordinarily active , creating more and more trouble for the japanese army in north china .
hayao tada , commander of the japanese north china area army , adopted a strategy of siege warfare to deal with the eighth route army .
the specific method was building a closely connected transport network , with a road for every village and defensive towers on every road .
roads and railways were used as links to connect all of north china into a solid , widespread siege , in order to strangle the eighth route army and its base areas in this net .
as part of the japanese army 's strategy of siege warfare , railways and roads had actually become the japanese army 's weapons of war , becoming a great threat to the base areas .
in december 1939 , commander - in - chief zhu de and vice commander peng dehuai of the eighth route army received a top - secret telegram from commander lu zhengcao of the jizhong military district , among other people .
the telegram said that the japanese troops were building blockade trenches and chessboard - like roads to divide the jizhong base area into small isolated blocks without the ability to mutually communicate and support each other , causing the eighth route army and the guerrillas to lose maneuverability .
before the hundred regiments offensive in 1940 , an inclination to compromise , ah , surrender , was an extremely serious crisis in the frontline situation in china .
well , on the battlefield behind enemy lines , in order to take over , consolidate the area under its occupation , japan began a new strategy .
that was to use railways as a pillar , (np=1 (nns roads a chain , and (np=1 (nns strongholds a lock , to carry out siege warfare in an attempt to divide the base areas behind enemy lines , ah , so as , er , to cut off their communication with one another .
in addition , it relied on this cage , ah , to further strengthen its assaults against the base areas .
er .
so , it was amidst such a grave international and domestic situation that the eighth route army led by the chinese communist party , ah , launched , ah , a strategic offensive called the hundred regiments offensive .
this plot of the japanese army drew great attention from zhu de and peng dehuai of eighth route army headquarters .
after meticulous studies and painstaking preparations by many parties , a battle plan based on surprise was formulated .
on july 22 , 1940 , a campaign preparation order to attack the zhengtai railway , jointly signed by zhu de , peng dehuai , and zuo quan , was sent to yan'an and all units of the eighth route army .
what was the purpose , purpose and goal of this campaign ?
it was to break through the japanese army 's siege policy against base areas behind enemy lines , and to avert the crisis of china 's compromise and surrender .
it was to overcome this crisis .
well , the hundred regiments offensive was divided into three phases .
beginning from august 20 , from august 20 to september 10 , the main purpose of the campaign was to sabotage the zhengtai railway .
the zhengtai railway started from zhengding , hebei in the east and ended in taiyuan in the west , with a total length of 243 kilometers traversing the taihang mountain range .
during the war of resistance against japan , the zhengtai railway was a key strategic transportation line for the japanese army in north china . it was also one of the major blockade lines for causing destruction to anti-japanese base areas .
(pp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (in along this railway line was the niangziguan pass , a natural barrier , and the jingjing coalmine , a key fuel base in yangquan for the japanese military in north china .
outside of taiyuan and shijiazhuang , the japanese military deployed the 4th , 8th , and 93rd mixed brigades and regiments , which were scattered among 50 strongholds along the railway line .
the situation was getting worse and worse for the eighth route army and the anti-japanese areas behind enemy lines .
actions had to be taken to break through the blockade .
on a night in late july 1940 , the atmosphere in zhuanbi village in shaanxi was unusual . villager xiao jianghe has a vivid memory of this piece of history .
on that dark night , everyone was sleeping when human voices and neighing horses were heard within the village . people all got up . did something happen ?
some folks got up .
opening the street gate , they saw a soldier standing by the gate .
folks , go back , go back , nothing is wrong .
our troops are just going to stay here for the night .
do n't say you are scared . our commander is coming . i am telling you to go back to %pw sleep peacefully .
ah , so we went back to sleep . ah , why should you come out if you were told not to ?
by the time we got up early the following morning , the sports ground in zhuanbi village was packed with soldiers who had stationed there .
essentially the entire enemy had been destroyed .
it was an arduous battle .
at 10:00 p.m. on august 20 , 1940 , various units of the eighth route army launched a full - scale offensive according to the general plan .
the head of the county people 's armed forces commission was named %pw zhao yemin .
zhao yemin came , ah , bringing a group of armed personnel and some things .
upon arriving , he relayed an order , saying the road from yangquan to hedi must be cut off tonight , with the electrical wires slashed .
he himself would bring these people , this group of people to blow up that wudu bridge . %pw
led by nie rongzhen , the shanxi - chahar - hebei military district was ready for an offensive , while at the same time , fifteen regiments laid an ambush in advance along the zhengtai railway , launching fierce attacks on japanese military strongholds along the railway line .
it was also during the night of august 20 that the 129th division directed by division commander liu bocheng and political commissar deng xiaoping , with eight regiments , including two regiments of the 1st dare - to - die corps and eight independent battalions , formed left - flank and right - flank commandos and a central contingent .
on the night of august 20 , offensives were launched against most of the japanese independent 4th mixed brigade and part of the independent 9th mixed brigade along the western section of the zhengtai railway .
additionally , two regiments , together with local armed forces in places such as pingding , liaoxian , and yushe , carried out sabotage on the pingliao and yuliao roads and pinned down the enemy at various points , ensuring safety of the main forces on the sides and rear .
current estimates are that this section was taken care of in less than four hours , three hours .
after this was taken care of , four blockhouses were blown up .
by digging tunnels , they charged out the center . only then did they wipe out the enemy , wipe out the enemy .
more than %pw two hundred enemy soldiers were eliminated in a single blow .
it was still during this night that the 120th division , directed by division commander he long and political commissar guan xiangying , with 20 regiments , sabotaged the northern section of the tongpu railway and some main roads west of the railway . it also took over strongholds at yangfangkou , kangjiahui , and fengrui village , cutting off the northern section of the tongpu railway and the roads from xinxian to jingle and fenyang .
in order to coordinate with breakthrough battles at the zhengtai railway and the northern section of the tongpu railway , the 129th division and the shanxi - chahar - hebei military district also ordered their units to deploy more than 50 regiments yang to lishi in cooperation with militias , to launch widespread sabotage and raids on the pinghan , pingsui , beining , baijin , jinpu , and deshi railway lines , among others , as well as some main roads and many strongholds occupied by the japanese army .
on the afternoon of august 22 , peng dehuai was listening to the combat operation director report on battle developments at eighth route army operational headquarters .
when asked about the actual combat strength of the eighth route army , the combat operation director reported there are 30 regiments along the zhengtai line , 15 regiments along the lugou bridge - handan section of the pinghan line , 12 regiments along the datong - hongdong section in tonghu county , and four regiments along the tianjin - dezhou section of the jinpu line , with a total of 105 regiments entering the campaign .
with a wave of his hand , peng dehuai said that despite being over 100 regiments , let 's call this campaign the hundred regiments offensive .
that afternoon , peng dehuai first used the name hundred regiments offensive in telegrams sent to various military corps and the central military commission .
a total of 105 regiments participated in the hundred regiments offensive .
well , it was a force of more than 200,000 soldiers .
in addition to that , er , no less than 400,000 militiamen , guerrillas , and civilians , er , voluntarily participated in the offensive .
so , there were probably 600,000 - plus soldiers and civilians .
the hundred regiments offensive dealt a devastating blow to the enemy at shi'nao mountain .
our troops were strong , troops were strong . er , and those in charge of logistics and support were able to follow in time .
er , our anti-japanese vanguard team , er , the anti-japanese vanguard team was composed of all young people in their 20s all young people , all in their 20s , 20s .
this is shi'nao mountain , situated in yangquan , shanxi , a strategic passage of the zhengtai railway back then .
on august 21 , 1940 , in order to pin down japanese troops stationed in yangquan and to cover for militiamen sabotaging the western section of the zhengtai railway , the 129th division of the eighth route army ordered the main regiment of its 385th brigade , the 14th regiment led by brigade commander chen xilian , to head directly for shi'nao mountain to seize the high ground .
like a sharp sword , civilians in the western section broke through the strategic passage .
frustrated and angry , the japanese army immediately deployed a large number of troops in an attempt to retake shi'nao mountain .
to the enemy 's complete surprise , desolate shi'nao mountain had been turned into a strong combat fortress by our troops in less than a night .
like a lion with its mouth wide open , towering and rugged shi'nao mountain was constantly waiting for any invaders who dared come close .
the night before , we destroyed the roads and cut off all electrical and railway lines , making it impossible for it to communicate .
it did not know how many of us went to destroy the roads , whether it was the eighth route army or not , (np-prd=3 (np (dt the regulars , or others . it did not know , right ?
after all , its telephones had stopped working .
yeah , the roads had been cut off , with its vehicles unable to drive back and forth .
the following seven days and nights were extremely tough .
starting from the 23rd , the japanese army in yangquan , backed by helicopters , launched nonstop fierce attacks on shi'nao mountain using chemical weapons .
during the shi'nao mountain battle , our soldiers died in large numbers . so many died that the clean - up was done in batches .
in addition , many people were poisoned when toxic gas was released .
they were poisoned and did not know how to protect themselves against the poison . they simply crawled on the ground and wetted handkerchiefs in the rain to cover their noses against the poison .
eh , medics were quite busy .
several days of autumn rain turned the combat trenches extremely muddy . the eighth route army officers and soldiers soaking in the muddy water fought their powerful enemy with utmost effort .
with bombs exploding next to the trenches , they showed no fear at all .
when their blood turned the yellow soil red , they applied iodine solution to their wounds and closed them with bandages .
they wrapped them with bandages , and that was it .
under the powerful offensive of the eighth route army , the enemy was only able to defend itself , without any strength to fight back .
the battle proceeded very smoothly , with the initiative steadily in the grasp of the eighth route army .
since the strategic objective of the hundred regiments offensive was to smash the enemy 's blockade of bases , it was of critical importance to destroy the roads and remove strongholds .
the various units of the eighth route army taking part in the battle wasted no time destroying the roads .
they proposed not to leave behind a single rail , a single cross tie , a single railway station , a single blockhouse , a single bridge , or a single electricity pole .
they mobilized and organized the masses and won over the railway staff , making great effort to destroy the railroad , the stations , and related facilities by means including dismantlement , explosion , fire , and water .
i was in charge of this , er , and --
er , er , due to this --
to cut off the electricity , er , considered a deputy commander - in - chief responsible for these electricity lines .
he , i was responsible for this project , ah .
the militiamen were divided into two groups . one was responsible only for cutting electrical wires , and (np-sbj=2 (dt the other destroying roads .
we people , ah , were under his command for the time being .
we all took part in destroying roads .
from the zhengtai road , from , um , zhengding to , um , shijiazhuang , to taiyuan , more than 400,000 civilians participated in destroying roads .
(adjp-prd-tpc-1 (rbs most important at that time along the zhengtai road was mainly to destroy the jinxi coal mine .
soldiers used hay cutters to sever the wire net , charging into the station and destroying the machine room and water tower , and then started to destroy the road .
of the three to four thousand civilians participating in the battle , one soldier was added to every squad of 16 people formed .
while destroying roads , there was clear - cut division of labor . some took off screws ; some uprooted rail spikes ; some knocked off joint bars ; some removed cross ties ; some carried away rails .
for cutting electrical wires , the militiamen in the village were waiting for the troops to come ,
ah ,
over there , a builder of the surrounding walls sabotaged transportation by pushing over his surrounding walls .
it was built during the day , and at night , overnight militiamen shoveled it over .
the task of the 72nd regiment was , er , this destruction battle .
this destruction battle went on for a day and a night . each day the general situation was different .
-lsb- -lsb- they attacked small bridges and small districts , and generally looted these stations . -rsb- -rsb-
they carried away the iron , the iron rails of the railway , er to make steel .
er , for wood materials , local folks simply destroyed them by fire .
in this way , they fought the battle while at the same time destroying roads , stripping the entire 60 - li - long railway from xingtai to neiqiu within just a few days .
in this way , a blockade line of steel regarded as a lifeline by the japanese army was paralyzed .
it was a very tough battle . the enemy attacked several times , and each time they were repelled . there were extremely heavy casualties .
overseas japanese in yangquan city were all mobilized to participate in the battle , including children of 15 to 16 years of age . they wanted to have , overseas compatriots get together so that they could support one another in wiping out the eighth route army and foiling our movement to destroy roads .
the hundred regiments offensive lasted three and a half months and involved two major offensive phrases and one anti-sweep phase .
during the first phase from august 20 to september 10 , 1940 , a general offensive was launched on major transportation lines such as the zhengtai , tongpu , pinghai , and jinfu lines with an emphasis on destroying the zhengtai railway .
during the second phase from september 22 to early october , the mission was to continue expanding battle achievements , to destroy the flanks of transportation lines , and to penetrate puppet strongholds in anti-japanese bases .
during the third phrase from october 6 to december 4 , the main task was to counterattack a retaliatory sweep by the japanese army and puppet army .
the eighth route army smashed successive large - scale sweep operations launched by the japanese army and puppet army against anti-japanese bases in taihang , taiyue , pingxi , beiyue , and northwest areas of shanxi , among others .
to those who have never experienced wars , wars are vivid stories . to those who have experienced wars , war is the course of life , part of life .
there are ,
at that time , the hundred regiments offensive greatly encouraged the vast numbers of soldiers and civilians , with news of fighting spreading rapidly throughout the taihang mountain area .
few of the veterans who participated in the hundred regiments offensive are still alive . when they speak of the hundred regiments offensive , they are always so excited .
everyone has their own memory , has the hundred regiments offensive as their own memory .
i was given five bullets ; er , i got five bullets . i carried these five bullets with me in my pocket . i took them out for a look every day . hey , this was my life . hey , this was my life . i could not lose them .
the squad leader said , at the time when you are given a rifle , you need to shoot . i will watch . if you fail to shoot the enemy , i will punish you when you come back .
do you know lice ? they bite . how do you scald them ?
hey ,
well , you boil some water and get something like gunpowder . then you loosen your pants and sprinkle it . clench it like this . then , you shake it , and you hear a cracking sound on the ground ; hey , scalded lice .
a washbasin was also very precious . how was the washbasin used ?
you used the washbasin to wash your feet , used the washbasin to hold your meal , used the washbasin to wash your face , and sometimes used the same washbasin to boil water . so , this washbasin was a precious washbasin .
this photo taken back then by eighth route army field correspondent xu xiaobing is a snapshot of peng dehuai directing the campaign at the frontline of the hundred regiments offensive .
just as mao zedong once praised : who dares wield his sword and make his horse rear ? only our great general peng .
correspondent xu xiaobing , covering frontline news at the time , snapped the shutter while artillery fire roared overhead .
more than 60 years later , xu xiaobing still vividly remembers the scene at that time .
dehuai was sitting in this trench directing the campaign .
oh .
bullets and artillery fire whistled past his head .
during the three and a half months from august 20 to december 5 , 1940 , the eighth route army fought a total of 1,824 battles large and small .
a total of 46,480 japanese soldiers and puppet soldiers were killed , wounded , or captured , or defected .
four hundred seventy - four kilometers of railroad and 1,502 kilometers of highway were destroyed .
in addition , large quantities of other military supplies were seized or destroyed .
after the eighth route army launched the hundred regiments offensive , newspapers from areas behind enemy lines in north china to the large rear area continuously carried news of victories .
telegrams and letters of congratulation arrived in yan'an from all directions .
mao zedong was deeply moved . this leader with a strong poetic temperament expressed his joy in this kind of telegram .
the hundred regiments offensive caused great excitement . can such kind of campaign be organized once or twice more ?
in a congratulatory telegram to zhu de and peng dehuai , chiang kai - shek praised the eighth route army 's resolute attacks for dealing a heavy blow to the enemy .
by pinning down large numbers of japanese soldiers on battlefields behind enemy lines in north china , the hundred regiments offensive delayed the japanese army 's aggression southward . in addition , the hundred regiments offensive was a response to the european battlefield , while enhancing the international reputation of the cpc and the eighth route army .
the hundred regiments offensive wrote a glorious page in the history of china 's war of resistance against japan .
on june 30 , 1987 , the monument to the hundred regiments offensive was erected on shi'nao mountain in yangquan , shanxi , where the heroes had fought the battle .
in 1993 , six villagers in honghecao village set up the hundred regiments offensive museum at the place of nie rongzhen 's operational command .
old li jingtang still tells visitors old war stories circulating in the taihong mountain area .
more than 60 years have passed since the hundred regiments offensive took place . taihang mountain will forever remember that great battle during the chinese people 's war of resistance against japan .
during world war ii , the two hundred thousand strong chinese expeditionary force went abroad to fight .
the burma road was the lifeline artery for china 's anti-japanese battlefields .
the tengchong battle , an annihilation of the japanese army , became a typical example for the china war area .
we respectfully invite you to watch a bloody battle fought side - by - side by china , the us , and britain 60 years ago in a joint effort to repel japanese invaders .

this is cctv focus today .
prior to the apec meeting , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi visited yasukuni shrine for the fifth time and was strongly condemned by asian nations such as china and south korea .
what kind of situation will japan find itself in at the apec summit ?
what heavy prices will japan pay for koizumi 's paying respect to the ghosts ?
focus today is coming up in a moment .
hello , dear viewers !
welcome to the live broadcast of focus today on the chinese international channel .
the apec meeting is being held these days in pusan , south korea .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi also arrived in pusan this afternoon , beginning his apec trip this time .
well , prior to this , many analysts all think that during his trip to the apec meeting in pusan , this time , junichiro koizumi may likely be isolated by various parties .
the reason is that in its persistent alignment with the us , japan has ignored its relations with other countries , especially its asian neighboring countries .
what is clearly remembered by its asian neighboring countries is that on october 17 this year , in spite of opposition , junichiro koizumi stubbornly visited , ah , visited yasukuni shrine for the fifth time during the four years since he took office .
well , what kind of situation will japan find itself in at the apec summit ?
what kind of impact will koizumi 's lame diplomacy produce on the international image of japan ?
these are all the topics we will be focusing on today .
we have invited to our studio professor liu jiangyong and professor jin xide , two experts on japan issues .
welcome you two to the studio to participate in our program .
well , we all know that koizumi arrived in pusan this afternoon .
in the afternoon he met with south korean president roh moo - hyun .
the two met .
well , from the information and the situation you have learned , how would you two interpret some messages sent out by their meeting this time ?
ah , first of all , i think , ah , this , this time , ah , when koizumi arrived in pusan , ah , he had this in his mind .
that is , through multilateral meetings , he attempted to meet with , ah , leaders of south korea or other asian nations , uh-huh . so as to uh-huh . demonstrate that even though he visited yasukuni shrine , uh-huh . his relations with neighboring countries are not affected .
uh-huh .
however , actually , today president roh moo - hyun of the hosting country of the meeting , uh-huh . well , based on his meeting with koizumi , i think , actually , it shows that a series of issues such as his visit to yasukuni shrine have indeed cast a very heavy shadow over the relations between the two countries .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yes .
well , during this meeting , er , president roh moo - hyun clearly pointed out , ah , what did he point out ? that is , er , the visit to yasukuni shrine by japanese leaders , politicians , and statesmen , is a challenge , provocation , provocation , ah , to south korea .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , at the same time , he pointed out , that is , er , the issue of the prime minister 's visit to yasukuni shrine , the textbook issue , and the territorial dispute .
uh-huh .
all these must be properly resolved before the relations between the two countries can improve .
uh-huh .
well , koizumi , he also said , that is to say , er , argued slyly for himself , ah , he said , er , that his visit was not to glorify the war .
uh-huh .
nor was this for anything else . it was only done to express condolences on the war dead .
uh-huh .
well , at the same time , that is , it was to express that there shall be no more war in future .
however , this was still not accepted by the south korean side .
well , after the meeting between the two sides , we were very interested in this .
that is , originally this year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between south korea and japan .
%pw fortieth anniversary .
in addition , is n't this year the year of the south korean - japanese friendship ?
yes , yes , yes .
uh-huh .
yes , yes , the year of friendship .
uh-huh .
er , well , according to the original arrangement , that is , president roh moo - hyun should pay a visit to japan , ah , at the end of this year .
uh-huh .
however , this matter was not even talked about during this bilateral , eh , bilateral summit meeting . i think this shows that it is not going to happen .
right .
uh-huh .
some commentaries said that when koizumi went to meet with roh moo - hyun this time , it was like clutching at a straw to save his life .
eh , it means that you see , although many neighboring countries are complaining about me , my image may return to a better one after i met with roh moo - hyun .
however , based on the outcome , just as professor liu %pw introduced , it was equivalent to going there to get criticized again .
right .
well , was n't it that things went contrary to his wishes ?
uh-huh , to him .
he , that is to say , to japan , to prime minister koizumi , this is a very difficult diplomatic journey .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , to be able to meet with roh moo - hyun was originally the only remedy he could count on .
uh-huh .
however , roh moo - hyun actually met with him ceremonially as a host because apec held the meeting in south korea .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but , he seized the opportunity fully to express the wish of the south korean government and people .
uh-huh .
what he meant by the wish was to stop visiting yasukuni shrine .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , contrary to koizumi 's diplomatic purpose , he not only failed to sidestep the issue of the visit , but rather exposed this kind of , this %pw scandal to the %pw entire world .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , from the bottom of his heart , he might feel it was even worse than not meeting at all .
uh-huh .
so , this only hope of his was also destroyed .
uh-huh .
we have just started with this topic of the meeting between president roh moo - hyun and koizumi .
well , actually , regarding , um , koizumi 's attendance at this apec summit , people are more interested in the relations between japan and its asian neighboring countries , including the kind of alliance relationship between the us and japan , and so on .
uh-huh .
yeah .
well , speaking of the relationship issue , we have noticed that during us president bush 's visit in japan , koizumi made some declaration of this position .
he said , as long as we get on good terms with the us , then it follows naturally we will have good relations with our asian neighboring countries .
well , regarding this attitude he has adopted , well , two professors , how would you look at koizumi 's diplomatic thinking ?
well , this is because he is still using the pre-cold - war diplomatic thinking after the cold war , that is , the united states is the number one superpower in the world .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
japan is the second largest economy in the world .
uh-huh .
as long as these two countries stand together , then it seems that other countries could not do anything to them .
uh-huh .
well , this is actually a very overbearing image .
uh-huh .
well , looking at the situation in asia , actually , it is exactly the other way round .
uh-huh .
that is to say , if it does not get on good terms with its asian neighboring countries , then in reality the us will become even more hard - line in its diplomacy with japan .
as for japan , to the us , it furthermore has lost some assets , diplomatic assets when making negotiations with the us .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , just recently , it 's needless for us to say , er , that japan 's relations with other countries , we can say , with its neighboring countries this year have suffered overall deterioration .
these include japan 's relations with south korea , china , and russia which are all deteriorating , well , even including its relations with the us .
in fact , we , even today , we also noticed a piece of news that although at the two - plus - two , um , the recent two - plus - two meeting , er , the us and japan again reached an intermediate report , uh-huh . uh-huh . uh-huh . well , today , actually the head of japan 's defense agency again mentioned to the us that it seems to feel regretful ,
why ?
uh-huh .
that is , a bit regretful .
because , according to the two - plus - two intermediate report just reached , the us military bases in japan should undergo adjustment .
however , it was met with strong opposition from the general public in japan . so it may be hard to implement .
uh-huh .
so , now the jda head came to talk with the us , saying , whether our interests can be taken into consideration again , er , in this intermediate report .
that is , between the us and japan , centering upon this intermediate report , actually the deal is again partially completed .
uh-huh .
so , such a prime minister like koizumi , who blindly follows the us as the guideline of his diplomacy , was rarely seen even during the cold war era .
uh-huh .
we know that in 1957 japan had three diplomatic principles . that is to say , it must take good care of its relations with the western countries , asian countries , and the united nations .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but now , koizumi is like a stick , let 's say , a post .
right .
it takes three points to support a plane .
yeah .
so , it turned out that they had such stuff on the surface .
well , some prime ministers before koizumi at least would still properly deal with and balance the relations with america , with the us and asia , in particular , with china , ah .
uh-huh .
well , when it comes to koizumi , he only takes good care of the relations with the us .
right .
in fact , he will surely fail to take good care of the relations with the us because if you can not win the trust of your asian neighboring countries , the us will not fully respect such a country .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the us also wants to go beyond japan to keep good relations with china , south korea , and other asian countries . therefore , the more he follows the us , the lower will be his actual status in asia .
uh-huh .
it is impossible .
right , his idea was actually criticized and opposed by some politicians even in japan .
he was strongly criticized and increasingly isolated .
ah .
the domestic economy was also affected .
many people also mentioned , by valuing the us alone , you are ignoring asia .
yes .
now many media all issued statements and editorials .
therefore , some people also compared this diplomacy of his to a lame diplomacy .
yeah .
he --
could he walk steadily with a lame diplomacy ?
eh , as far as koizumi himself is concerned , what is his problem ?
uh-huh .
he himself , ah , er , %pw what should we say ? he does not respect and acknowledge reality . actually , some people say he is deceiving himself as well as others .
uh-huh .
for instance , this time at the apec meeting in pusan , when he mentioned , er , japan 's relations with china , he still used this kind of , that is to say , rhetoric , to defend himself .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
he said , er , sino - japanese relations , ah , right now , japan - china relations are not like , er , what the international community is worried about .
uh-huh .
well , the economic trade %pw development in our two countries is going on quite well .
in fact , we can say he does not understand the current status of sino - japanese relations .
uh-huh .
actually , due to his visit to yasukuni shrine and the cooling down of the political relationship , %pw %pw %pw sino - japanese relations have suffered severe blows .
he is only indulging in his unilateral wishful thinking .
it is only what he thinks .
uh-huh .
we can see some concrete figures . for instance , from january to august this year , the latest statistics show that japan 's exports to china grew only by 3.2 % according to china 's statistics .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it grew only by 5.8 % according to japan 's statistics .
uh-huh .
well , in previous years , it was always more than 25 % . in other words , japan 's exports to china were declining sharply .
more than 25 % .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , at the same time , with respect to japan 's investment in china , during the first half of last year , japan 's investment projects in china decreased by 8.2 % while the contractual amount decreased by 0.4 % . they both showed that due to the cooling down of the political relationship , well , the economic relations between china and japan have already been severely affected .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
in addition , there has also been the impact on the feelings of peoples of the two countries .
yeah .
originally , koizumi 's key fallacy for his visits to yasukuni shrine was that my visits would not affect in any way our relations with asia .
uh-huh .
it is not like that in reality .
uh-huh .
well , when koizumi visits yasukuni shrine , he is betting on the national interests of japan . that is to say , he is selling the international image and national interests of japan at cheap prices .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so this is being paid at a heavy price .
uh-huh .
many japanese people also see that this does not conform to japan 's own fundamental interests , ah , as a country with so many international , um , interests .
interests .
with national interests .
at the same time , it also actually denigrates japan 's image .
uh-huh .
well , with regard to koizumi 's diplomatic thinking , there is still one point , that is , one question . ah , people may also frequently ask such a question that since it is the most important thing for a country to keep good relationship with its neighboring countries , why would japan want to seek far and wide for what lies close at hand ?
right .
out of what consideration is he doing this ?
well , um , this prime minister koizumi , ah , first of all , personally , he is an individual with a kind of belief , a very rightist political belief .
well , it also precisely reflects a current political trend of forces surrounding the koizumi administration .
uh-huh .
it also reflects that nowadays japan , in its eagerness to become a political power , well , wants to take advantage of the sentiments of extreme nationalism to move toward and realize this goal .
for instance , they have a kind of , a kind of wrong doing . that is to say , if japan wants to become a powerful country commanding true respect , it must get rid of the name of a defeated country , the name of an aggressor country in world war ii .
uh-huh .
so , they chose a very dangerous road .
uh-huh .
that is to say , it tries to become a decent country by negating its history as an aggressor . this is exactly a road that leads nowhere .
uh-huh .
well , this road he takes will surely isolate japan from the international community and will definitely not make it a political power in the end .
uh-huh .
well , he chose the wrong road .
ah , in addition , from his point of view , he is counting on his luck to a large extent . we can also say that some think tank people around him may have given him the wrong idea .
perhaps he was misled , wow .
ah .
for example , regarding his visits to yasukuni shrine , he simply thinks , he says , if i keep doing it , keep doing it like this , you china , south korea , ah , you , that is to say , you will be tired of protesting , grow tired of protesting .
once you see a lot of it , you will get used to it .
so , you will swallow the bitterness while i keep doing like this .
uh-huh .
however , it turns out to be exactly the opposite . he did not know this issue could bring big trouble to japan .
he did not know the seriousness of the issue .
this is , this is an issue of principle .
right .
well , we can say that an overall review of the current diplomatic status of japan should show two clear roads . ha , one is to follow the us blindly , which is one of its very important diplomatic lines .
and we can also see the other one , that is , to continue damaging the relations with its close neighbors
well , speaking of this , we can also figure out that koizumi has seriously damaged the feelings of his asian neighboring countries several times since he took office as japan 's prime minister in 2001 .
we compiled a background video clip here , and let 's learn about some relevant information together .
in february 2005 , just one day after chinese people 's traditional spring festival , the japanese government claimed the lighthouse set on diaoyu island by japan 's extreme rightist group without permission as its national property and put in under the administration of japan .
on march 16 , 2005 , japan 's shimane prefecture assembly voted to pass a measure bill concerning takeshima day and officially designated february 22 as takeshima day . as a result , this small island just a bit over 90 kilometers from utsuryo island , south korea , again triggered a diplomatic conflict between the two countries .
south korea thinks that this island called dokdo island has always been a korean territory .
on april 1 , 2005 , the japanese ministry of education approved a new edition of history textbooks compiled by the new history textbook compilation committee and published by fusosha publishing house and announced the result officially on april 5 .
there are very few amendments in the new edition of japanese history textbooks . the parts of the old version that twisted the history and denied its crime of aggression remained unchanged . instead the japanese claims of sovereignty of south korea 's dokdo island and china 's diaoyu island were added .
with regard to the yasukuni shrine where class a ww ii criminals are honored , in spite of opposition from all sides , koizumi persistently paid a series of five visits there from 2001 to 2005 .
koizumi has been in office for four years , four years .
well , during these four years , we can say , er , nothing has been much improved , whether in internal affairs or diplomacy .
originally , koizumi , ah , took office because he won a very high support rating as a reformer .
eh , at that time , he pledged to reform japan 's internal political and economic situations .
however , based on the current status of internal affairs , his reform , ah , did not result , er , in what was expected at that time .
in the diplomatic field , there has been constant friction with neighboring countries .
so , right now , another important question is how exactly people in japan view koizumi 's diplomatic or internal policies , professor jin ?
well , this is , let 's say that %pw japanese people now have finally started to cool down in their attitude toward this kind of his methods , this kind of impulsive actions .
uh-huh .
well , we know that among major japanese newspapers , that is , the most dominant newspapers expressing popular opinions , ranging from asahi shimbun to tokyo shimbun , etc , well , recently , even yomiuri simbun , which originally expressed support for koizumi 's right - wing tendencies , has started to change sides .
uh-huh .
that is to say , their tones might be different , but the consensus of japanese public opinion is that relations with asian countries must be improved . so , this has already become the mainstream japanese public opinion .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , specifically , it means prohibiting visits to yasukuni shrine . this has been opposed by the liberal democratic party and all opposition parties .
well , we know that the most important pillar in japan that supports the japanese society is the japanese business community .
well , the heads of several groups in the business community , for instance , the japan business federation and the japan committee for economic development , all had frequent direct meetings with koizumi , strongly cautioning him not to visit yasukuni shrine , uh-huh . uh-huh . because our economy will suffer if our japan can not survive in the international community .
uh-huh .
as a result , nowadays , koizumi should be utterly isolated not only internationally but also domestically .
uh-huh .
right .
well , to japanese people , what they are more concerned with is , for example , how my economy is developing , how my life will be , whether the national interests will be damaged , whether my personal interests will be affected , and so on and so forth .
well , we have noticed that in response to such questions , some analysts recently noted that japan 's diplomacy will pay a heavy price for what he has been doing .
as a matter of fact , professor liu , you also mentioned earlier that japan 's economy , for instance , the sino - japanese trade , has already been affected to some extent . well , have they started to pay the price already ?
well , i think , actually , as far as japan itself is concerned , it still made some mistakes by itself . for instance , actually koizumi won an overwhelming victory in the general election held on september 11 this year . at the same time his power to form the cabinet was further strengthened .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
er , he himself thought , er , that he was probably 100 % , 200 % , er , 200 % correct in what he has been doing .
uh-huh .
however , in his diplomatic efforts , in terms of relations with neighboring countries , well , we should say , we can say that he indeed failed miserably .
uh-huh .
well , this itself also failed to meet japan 's own demand for economic development and the trend of strengthening economic and trade relations with foreign countries , in particular , the eastern asian region , well , so as to bring about economic cooperation in this region .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , looking at japan 's economy , we should say it is currently recovering its growth .
well , externally , it mainly relies on the us and chinese markets .
uh-huh .
however , if the chinese market suffers from economic cool - down as political coldness takes heat off economic development , it should produce a very negative effect on japan 's economy .
uh-huh .
this effect may not show until probably next year .
uh-huh .
well , just now professor liu said , that is to say , it was the political coldness that totally damaged its relations with neighboring countries .
uh-huh .
then , in terms of economy , he has also been unable to keep the economic heat on .
uh-huh .
well , we know , what all of us should be more concerned is his failure in international affairs .
that is , this year marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of the united nations .
uh-huh .
japan placed its hope of becoming a permanent member of the security council this year .
uh-huh .
well , generally speaking , if it could n't get accepted this year , well , the chances in future are extremely slim .
uh-huh .
well , among many reasons that blocked japan from getting accepted this year , the most important one was that its neighboring countries did not cast favorable votes .
that is , it did not --
it failed to gain the support of countries in its own region .
right .
to become a permanent member of the security council , the most important thing is to first win the support of your own region .
right .
well , right now it is its neighboring countries that did not support it .
uh-huh .
therefore , we should say that it is koizumi , right , this prime minister koizumi who has single - handedly ruined japan 's dream of becoming a permanent member of the security council .
uh-huh .
this is the most serious cost .
some analysts also mentioned this point , that is to say , right now , japan 's neighboring countries are basically very much disappointed with what koizumi has been doing .
well , many countries have all abandoned their hopes to further mend their relations with japan .
in this respect , %pw such a question follows , that is , how far could koizumi go following his diplomatic policy ?
well , from what can be seen now , that is , actually , er , let 's say , from the cabinet he formed after his victory of the general election for the second time , we could indeed see that he has gathered , um , the statesmen , or politicians who approve visits to yasukuni shrine , uh-huh . all into the cabinet , everyone of them , eh .
he appointed them as , right , appointed them as defense minister or foreign minister .
uh-huh .
in fact we can see that he is sort of determined on this issue to fight against neighboring countries to the end .
uh-huh .
this way , he actually sent out a message that he has no sincerity in improving , during his term , improving the relations with neighboring countries .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
this will indeed lead to the great disappointment of neighboring countries in him , and furthermore to their caution about whether next , the prime minister , the defense minister , including , er , the foreign minister would all go pay their respects at yasukuni shrine .
if that is the case , it may have produced a very extensive negative impact on its relations with neighboring countries .
uh-huh .
well , actually , right now even the european and us media have noted this issue .
right .
we , including us president bush , who came to pusan following his visit to japan this time and then will arrive again in china , are , in fact , also very concerned with this future development of sino - japanese relations .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that is because i recently met an american scholar whose first question to me was whether there will be any conflict in the east china sea region .
uh-huh .
ah , i do n't think it would be that serious , but we can see that the international community has already shown tremendous concern about the chaos to international relations in this region that may have resulted from the koizumi cabinet 's reckless diplomacy .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
in fact it is not merely an issue of sino - japanese relations or japanese - korean relations .
it has triggered that --
yeah .
the nerves of the international community .
yeah .
that is , the us public and scholars have started , started to show concerns over the issue of right and wrong in ww ii , the moral issue , that is , the us has started to pay attention to this issue .
the us has kept quiet on the issue of yasukuni shrine because it wants to get along with everyone .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , it has been an onlooker to the fighting among eastern asian countries . but now the us can no longer sit quietly any more . i think that if things go on like this , the us interests in this region are also going to suffer .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , now let 's look at this koizumi , that is , the post-koizumi era . what are his standards for selecting his successor ? is visiting yasukuni shrine a criterion ?
uh-huh .
yeah .
this is one of the important indexes that i , we should watch for regarding which road exactly japan will take .
however , based on the selection and formation of his , er , cabinet , it seems that koizumi is making his post-resignation arrangements , ah . he has started to get ready .
the koizumi era , well --
has already prepared --
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , following that , for instance , if his successor is indeed shinzo abe , well , what will it mean if shinzo abe takes office ?
well , actually , i see , ah , koizumi has dual purposes in arranging this cabinet , ah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that is , in fact , i now feel that he , er , is somewhat adopting a china policy that separates politics from economy .
uh-huh .
well , in politics , he will go against you , eh , mainly on the issues of yasukuni shrine and textbooks , but in economic and trade affairs , er , he still wants to safeguard japan 's economic rights .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
he is using some , eh , people who are , for instance , er , relatively moderate and pragmatic toward china .
right .
right , right , right . for instance , for instance , a politician quite friendly with china , that is , toshihiro nikai , um , was appointed as minister of economy , trade and industry .
uh-huh .
toshihiro nikai .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , we also see that after nikai took office , his speech on the eastern china sea issue , we should say , is quite appropriate .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
ah , in his opinion , he wants to have friendly negotiations , ah , with china if he sees that china , er , has taken any action .
he does not think japan 's unilateral action in this disputed area is friendly negotiation .
uh-huh .
if it is impossible for talks to go on , it can still be postponed till future , en , when there is a chance to resume talks .
er , i think that to prevent the bilateral relations from suffering friction over specific issues , his attitude like this should be --
uh-huh .
but , can his diplomacy featuring two separate political and economic lines work ?
eh , we need to watch for it this year .
uh-huh .
well , now koizumi is constantly sending out the message that he will step down voluntarily in september next year .
well , of course we could not believe completely 100 percent of what he said about this , because it is not certain whether they will make accommodations to let koizumi stay in office .
but , if he steps down in september next year , we will see who on this cabinet will be the prime minister .
uh-huh .
well , mainly we will see whether he gives priority to diplomacy or internal affairs and whether he is more a hawk or a dove .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
we know there are several other people , such as sadakazu tanigaki and other economic figures who emphasize on internal emphasize , er , %pw , and those people mentioned by professor liu just now like toshihiro nikai .
uh-huh .
this koizumi has made some preparations after all , that is , he made dual preparations .
uh-huh .
so , we still have to urge this japanese government , ah , not to continue isolating itself like this .
we are certainly willing to watch for this , and will continue to monitor japan .
all right . for our final topic , let 's go back to the apec meeting this time .
uh-huh .
well , as we mentioned earlier at the beginning , eh , that a very important purpose for koizumi to go to attend the apec leaders ' summit in pusan this time is to see if he could try to improve the relations with neighboring countries through talks with president roh moo - hyun , as if he were clutching at a life - saving straw .
but , could you analyze and predict what kind of achievements he can make during his trip to pusan ?
well , i think that actually the greatest achievement for him is that he should see facts .
what kind of facts ? that is , the issue of right and wrong .
well , some people say that as china 's economy is growing , japan is getting somewhat jealous .
er , as two powers are juxtaposed , the relations between the two countries have become somewhat tense .
in reality it is not necessary so . for instance , china 's economy is growing , eh , and getting stronger , but we see the relations between china and south korea are indeed developing rapidly .
uh-huh .
well , the current trade between china and south korea has reached nearly 100 billion us dollars .
uh-huh .
er , within another period of time , er , that is , by 2012 when it is the 20th anniversary , the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and south korea , 200 billion us dollars ' worth of %pw economic trade can be reached .
yeah .
so , this will have surpassed what it is now for japan and china which still failed to reach 200 billion us dollars at this 33rd anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relations .
uh-huh .
we can say , the economic development in south korea and china , to borrow roh moo - hyun 's words , is developing rapidly .
uh-huh .
in addition , we can see that south korea has been improving its relations with all neighboring countries with the exception of japan .
uh-huh .
china has also significantly improved its relations with all neighboring countries with the exception of japan .
uh-huh .
it is the same with russia .
yeah .
we should say , should say that people in the world are very clear about what is right and wrong .
it is all in the hearts of people .
yeah .
i think this can only prove koizumi 's stubbornness .
i do n't think it is certain at this point that he will change suddenly and completely .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that is to say , this time he could only further expose his poor diplomatic skills and his isolation to the international community .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , based on his past remarks and deeds , it is hard to determine whether he will suddenly change his diplomatic policy after he returns .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , there is very little chance in this regard .
er , judging from the situation he is in while participating in the apec meeting , er , i am afraid he may not be suffering from friction with neighboring countries only .
apart from that , er , some sources disclosed , for instance , he has also had some problems on this issue with some latin american countries .
yes .
so , just as we mentioned at the start of the program , during his trip to pusan , koizumi must feel not only isolated but also surely frustrated .
uh-huh .
all right .

hello , dear viewers . welcome to focus today .
after repeatedly postponing his trip to japan , russian president putin finally arrived at japan 's haneda airport on november 20 , beginning a three - day visit to japan .
it can be said that the four northern islands issue is always an obstacle that putin can not sidestep while visiting japan .
heading a russian business delegation of more than one hundred people this time , putin wants to improve bilateral relations through promoting economic development .
well , how will the four northern islands issue dead knot be untied ? and will economic and trade exchange between russia and japan be hampered because of this ?
these are all topics we will be focusing on today . two experts have been invited to our studio . let me briefly introduce , one is mr. jin xide , an expert on japanese issues from the academy of social sciences .
hello !
the other one is mr. xing guangcheng , an expert on russian issues from the academy of social sciences .
hello !
welcome to the two experts , for coming to the studio for our interview .
well , at the beginning of the program , let 's learn about the situation in japan .
let 's now connect via telephone with mr. wang xinsheng , an expert on japanese issues from beijing university who is currently visiting japan .
hello , professor wang .
ah , hello , host !
first , please brief us on what was discussed during today 's talks between the russian and japanese leaders . was the four northern islands issue touched upon ?
eh , well , president putin and prime minister koizumi , ah , the two talked for a total of two and a half hours and signed a total of 12 documents . it should be said that quite a large number of documents were signed .
however , the general reaction from scholars , media , or ordinary people here , er , is rather low key , because , er , there has been no progress on the two issues that japan is relatively concerned with , the northern territories issue , er , and the oil pipeline route issue .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
regarding the northern territories issue , this russian , er , president putin purposely avoided this issue , that is , he did not really want to talk about it .
uh-huh .
well , in fact , it can be said that there has still been no progress on territorial issues .
uh-huh .
so the two sides abandoned plans for a joint declaration .
well , on the oil pipeline route issue , though the russian side promised to connect it with japan , there was no talk about prioritizing a connection with japan .
the media here is concerned because russia already promised to prioritize connecting it with china , er , %pw , so the media here is concerned that it is an empty promise .
in this way , japan may not get , er , any material benefit , while the russian side will have gained japan 's support for its wto accession .
er , in addition , at the business federation meeting , russian president putin urged the japanese business community to invest in russia .
however , due to the territorial issues , or little progress on the territorial issues , along with the business community 's concerns with the investment environment in russia , well , it remains a big question how far economic cooperation can go .
uh-huh .
host .
this was the main content of the two leaders ' talks today .
well , what kind of response did people in japan have to some of the achievements putin made during his trip to japan , well , some of the achievements this trip to japan has made ?
er , it is still rather , er , low key .
because , that is to say , ah , er , we also saw , er , in tokyo , some right - wing groups held demonstrations , demanding that russia return , return the four northern islands .
well , they are also extremely dissatisfied because no progress has been made on this issue .
well , both the media and citizens have such concerns , that is to say , they are afraid that resolution of territorial issues may take rather .
host .
okay , thank you very much , professor wang , for briefing us on the relevant information in japan . thank you !
well , next we will return to the studio to interview the two experts in the studio .
just now , this professor wang talked about putin 's visit to japan this time .
although the two sides signed 12 agreements , it seems that japan is not very satisfied with the content of the agreements , ah , in terms of the content , because it seems that neither of the two issues that japan wanted greatly to talk about , the four northern islands issue and the oil pipeline issue , made the achievements they had anticipated .
well , was this within the expectations of you two experts ?
right , this is rather consistent with unanimous international public opinion analysis as well as our opinion these days .
uh-huh .
well , this , this , this discussion , it was a meeting of the leaders of both sides , which by itself is an achievement .
uh-huh .
as we know , putin has kept putting off this visit to japan since last year , like back then when yeltsin repeatedly postponed his trip to japan .
that is to say , japan asked for too high a price .
that is , it asked the russian president to come to japan to make concessions on territorial issues .
well , %pw , well , the russian president was still unwilling , was unwilling to make concessions . therefore , the itinerary was not decided for a long time .
well , russia 's attitude was that it would not talk about territorial issues if it went .
well , this japan , from the perspective of japan , without discussion of territorial issues , the talks were viewed as making no progress . for japanese citizens , this was meaningless .
uh-huh .
it only provided koizumi with a diplomatic stage .
what method does he want to use to remedy the lethargic post-apec diplomatic situation ?
well , what russia actually wants is economic cooperation with japan ,
uh-huh .
including the development of oil resources in eastern siberia , and , um , some other investment and trade .
well , japan is still like this , saying first return the territories , then we can talk about economics .
well , this time , based on the outcome this time , i think this basic structure remains unchanged .
uh-huh .
er , director xing , it can be said that this time one of the very important purposes of president putin 's visit to japan is to facilitate the progress of bilateral relations through economic development .
but from what our professor wang has just introduced , do you think putin has achieved his aim ?
eh , he should be said to have achieved his aim .
uh-huh .
the visit to japan was in itself one of putin 's important aims .
uh-huh .
because with large preconditions having been set , and now the framework having being set , it is impossible for putin to have further substantive , that is to say , to make major breakthroughs on the substantive issues of russian - japanese relations .
uh-huh .
well , as two neighboring nations , ah , relations between them should be developed , development of relations should be further promoted . there should be exchanges back and forth , which would not work if putin refuses to go , refuses to come .
so , well , how did he come , how did he come to japan ?
as mentioned earlier , ah , it had been postponed again and again , but by way of this kind of opportunity , well , putin 's visit to japan was smoothly accomplished .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
as to what kind of result you want , that is another matter .
right .
but making the trip was significant in itself .
what was the significance ? it was that russia sent a very important message , that is , russia is willing to develop relations with japan .
we sincerely have such a wish . a wish is the start of achieving results . we have such a start .
both leaders saved a bit of face .
right , right , right , in addition to giving face to each other . also , on the surface we saw it looked fine , with 12 , 12 documents signed as just mentioned .
they both gave face .
right .
it is another matter if you care about the size of the documents . but they were signed .
uh-huh .
well , can we interpret it this way ?
based on the briefing given by you two experts , both japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and russian president putin , they both achieved their own aims in form and got or , er , obtained what they wanted through this visit .
on this point , their two fates are connected .
uh-huh .
that is to say , both sides have strong nationalist sentiments domestically and powerful parliaments . well , i think at this point it would be ludicrous for putin to concede on the territorial issues .
uh-huh .
well , as you should know , it is entirely impossible , impossible behavior .
right .
well , it seems it may also be very difficult for koizumi now , that is to say , on the territorial issues , to return to what is called , er , economics first , territories second , or the separation of politics and economics , the separation of politics and economics , or two islands first , then two islands later .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , recently taro aso again proposed , that is , new prime %pw , new foreign minister aso proposed a theory of joint development , that is , to postpone -lsb- -lsb- the issue of sovereignty of the northern -rsb- -rsb- and to jointly develop the four , four islands , four islands .
well , in fact the theory of joint development was originally proposed by russia . well , in the past , for instance , in 1996 , primakov also proposed it when he was foreign minister .
it had been raised prior to that too , but japan did not accept it at that time .
well , why did taro aso recently again propose such a , er , such a suggestion ?
well , i checked some data , ah . japan 's recent reaction is not japan 's mainstream domestic opinion .
uh-huh .
well , domestic political circles in japan all opposed this suggestion by taro aso .
uh-huh .
they said that with joint development , russia would advocate adopting the current russian controlled situation , the current situation , and applying russian law . well , by making investments there , in fact , well , it would be equivalent to permanent recognition that the four islands are russia 's .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so this theory of joint development will not be able to make progress either . so under the current situation , the meeting of the two leaders itself was the greatest achievement this time . the rest did not have any substantive significance .
right .
uh-huh .
i 'd like to add a few words . regarding the joint development he talked about , russia is also very interesting . now russia , the japanese proposed it , now russia instead rejected it . it rejected it , its government stated very clearly , we can not jointly develop the four northern islands . this is a very interesting issue .
right .
they dropped it .
right .
what do you say about this ?
er , it , russia , it also has , it also has , also has its vigilance .
well , this also has a lot to do with russia 's strategy of building a powerful nation .
russia now , it has independently formulated a strategic vision of developing the far east and siberian regions . it has such a vision .
uh-huh .
the four northern islands are included in this grand vision .
right .
today , among our topics , the four northern islands can be said to be the core topic .
we can discuss this issue again in detail at the end .
well , before this , we have one more question , that is , er , regarding the issue of this russian president putin 's repeated postponement of his visit to japan ,
well , many viewers may have some questions on this issue .
well , we happen to have a background video clip here . let 's gain some understanding through this background %pw background video clip .
why did russian president putin visit japan again after five years , an interval of five years , after quite a few twists and turns ?
it can be said that putin 's visit to japan after an interval of five years was realized following quite a few twists and turns .
the visit was first scheduled for the second half of 2004 . the japanese side hoped that after winning the presidential election in march of that year , putin could personally intervene in the territorial issues existing between japan and russia for a long time .
however , by may , the russian side said it could not provide measures for resolving the territorial issues , and putin 's visit to japan was pushed to the spring of 2005 .
while japan expressed helplessness to this , it hoped putin could visit in february as it was the 150th anniversary of the signing of a trade and border treaty between japan and russia .
however , putin responded only with a congratulatory telegram , with no mention of his visit to japan .
on september 2 , 2004 , koizumi went by boat to tour the four northern islands . this move at once infuriated russia . accordingly , the date of putin 's visit to japan turned into a variable which nobody could explain .
in various versions , some said putin would visit japan in april 2005 , (np-sbj=1 (dt some said , while others said june .
in russia 's diplomatic circles , there were even widespread rumors , including that putin would not visit japan within the year and that russia 's ambassador to japan would soon be removed .
various speculation existed until may 2005 , at the celebration of the 60th anniversary of victory in the world 's anti-fascist war .
under pressure from various sides , koizumi reluctantly attended this celebration . furthermore , precisely because of this , putin 's visit to japan was basically confirmed .
this time , on this visit between japan and the us , er , between russia and japan , ah , er , as far as japan was concerned , it really hoped that russian president putin would talk about the four northern islands issue during his visit .
however , russia 's thinking was , er , we want to develop the economy first .
there should be economic cooperation before we can talk about the four northern islands issue , which means that currently the two sides both insist on a condition from the other side .
well , in this way , the conflict would become more conspicuous during the talks .
well , was this also the reason that caused russian president putin , in spite of the two being close neighbors these five years , to visit japan again only after these five years , an interval of five years ?
this is already , this is not just during putin 's tenure , that is , it has been like this for the 60 years after the war .
uh-huh .
that is , whether there should be a separation of politics and economics or not . that is , whether it should be economic cooperation first or resolution of political issues first .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , this eased for a period after the cold war during the gorbachev era .
uh-huh .
that is , gorbachev recognized the four islands issue between japan and russia .
there was nothing like this in the past . in the past , only the issue of two islands was recognized .
well , there was once an opportunity for this , but japan again did not seize it .
uh-huh .
russia has changed a lot as well .
well , later , that is , after several changes , for instance , during hashimoto ryutaro 's term , ah , russia proposed separating politics from economics , to make progress on both at the same time .
uh-huh .
however , when it came to the critical moment , that is , on the territorial issues , perhaps due to japan 's domestic nationalist sentiments and the sensitivity of the territorial issues , it was impossible for any prime minister to claim for two islands only .
uh-huh .
when talks on the two islands came to a final decision , the japanese prime minister retreated again to the point that politics and economics could not be separated and that political issues should still be resolved first .
uh-huh .
well , in addition , the russian president was exactly the opposite , that is , denying at critical moments that there were territorial issues , that is , sometimes even the issue of the two islands .
uh-huh .
that is , it was impossible to give the territories to japan .
so , this shows how difficult it is to resolve japanese - russian relations .
uh-huh .
i think in the near future , er , the possibility of breakthrough progress is also very little , very small .
eh , we all know japan is the second largest economy in the world .
furthermore , japan is also a very important investor overseas . however , a set of data shows that japanese investment in russia accounts for only 1 % of its investments overseas , that is , just over 700 million us dollars .
well , as russia should be said to badly need japanese funds , as well as badly needing japanese economic cooperation , well , how urgent do you think russia 's need is ?
i think the time of russia 's most urgent need is already over .
uh-huh .
the most urgent time was still the 1990s .
at that time , russia was indeed pressing for japanese investment .
uh-huh .
because russia was in a high degree , or deep degree of overall crisis .
uh-huh .
it was like a very thirsty man who needs to drink water . at such time , he needs , needs someone else to give him a cup of water .
uh-huh .
well , now , the economic crisis in russia is essentially over .
well , under such circumstances , russia , er , it can make diplomatic arrangements calmly .
uh-huh .
therefore , i think japan , that is , again lost the best opportunity to enter the %pw russian market .
uh-huh .
it can not be said to have lost it forever . in other words , that time was the best , a relatively good period .
uh-huh .
why should we say that ?
that is to say , at that time if japan had made a very good investment in russia , well , japan , in terms of russia 's economy , it could have helped russia 's economic recovery .
uh-huh .
well , currently japan is very important to russia again .
well , as a neighboring nation , especially as japan is a world economic power , russia really needs japanese investment , now not japanese aid , but its investment .
uh-huh .
it can also be said it is this way strategically .
putin 's current strategy is to build a powerful nation , a strategy for making his country powerful and his people rich .
uh-huh .
well , this strategy is extremely clear . he used an expression , saying that russia 's diplomacy is economic diplomacy .
all economic %pw , diplomatic activities must promote russia 's prosperity , eh , development , and wealth and power .
uh-huh .
well , seen from this perspective , well , %pw japan is very important to russia .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
therefore , just now you mentioned some figures regarding russian - japanese relations , that is , economic and trade relations , for such a large , such a powerful economy as japan , well , it invested only 700-plus million in russia . this is extremely small .
uh-huh .
said it will be ten billion .
well , last year 's trade volume was perhaps more than 9 billion . this year , %pw , koizumi said it may exceed 100 trillion .
this is a very small figure in terms of trade relations between two countries .
it has nearly reached 200 billion between china and japan .
so .
right .
here it has a comparison .
er , between russia and japan , the trade volume only equals , of sino - japanese trade volume , one twenty - second .
uh-huh . right . it seems to be one twenty - second , or one nineteenth . well , what does this status show ?
right , just about , eh .
it shows i will explain two issues one , it may show that the economic environment in russia is indeed not very good .
uh-huh .
in general , none of the various countries , eh , large nations in the world , have entered the russian market with much ease .
uh-huh .
this is an objective factor , but there is a subjective factor too . that is to say , it is not that japan does not need the russian market . perhaps some non-economic factor is playing a role .
it has always been the territorial issue .
well , as we said , this kind of nationalist sentiment plays a great role here .
so one very important aim of putin 's visit this time , which i also think is very clever , is to put aside some very sensitive old territorial topics . this topic is hard to tackle .
uh-huh .
however , he can promote the development of economic relations , as economics is a dynamic factor .
uh-huh .
putin came this time bringing more than 100 people , such a large delegation , to japan . he still intends to solicit businesses and investment , to use our chinese expression , yet this intention is very obvious .
right , right .
right , i think .
however , based on this outcome , the form still seems to have outdone the content .
i think that with regard to japan 's relations with russia , it has been like this since the 1970s . when tanaka kakuei went there , he also did this . i will invest , i will give you aid to develop eastern siberia .
that 's because russia has a vast area of land . we know the population is small , that is to say they can not develop it . that is , the treasure is all hidden underground .
well , at that time it , it still , they still wanted to solve the population problem .
uh-huh .
so this , that is , japan used economics for political purposes .
uh-huh .
well , now it seems that koizumi has still not changed this course .
uh-huh .
well , this way , i do n't think this dead knot can be untied .
also , if things continue like this , increasing the nations ' mutual trust can never be realized .
yes , this is , eh , just now director xing mentioned a very important issue , that is , the nationalist sentiment .
in fact , regarding putin 's visit to japan this time , the media earlier predicted , among other things , that when the time came , there would be more than %pw 60 groups totaling more than 700 people , along with more than 200 propaganda trucks , hey , more than 200 propaganda trucks on the streets of downtown tokyo , to protest against putin 's visit to japan .
well , what forces do these people and groups holding street protests represent ? what are they asking for ? and what impact will it have on putin 's visit to japan ?
okay .
they are some focused right - wing groups , similar to a gang society .
but , with regard to this russian issue , ah , this can not be simply regarded as a handful of people making trouble , because there are widespread historical grievances among ordinary people in japan against russia . i have had contact with many japanese . that is to say , this involves the origin of the northern territories issue .
well , i think it originated a long time ago and involves three major issues .
one is that historically and legally , it has changed several times . for instance , in 1855 , in 1875 , and in 1905 after the russo - japanese war , and also ww ii , at these critical points , ownership of the territories was constantly changing .
with ancestors constantly changing , both sides had their own arguments .
in fact , ownership of the northern territories has changed several times , and there has been no single law . therefore , there is truth on both sides .
uh-huh .
now russia says this was the result of wwii international laws and treaties , with the us also recognizing it at that time .
uh-huh .
the entire international community recognizes that the four islands should belong to russia . both the yalta agreement and article 2 of the san francisco treaty recognize japan 's relinquishment of the kuril islands .
however , then there is a lot of nationalist sentiment , that is , japan believes that the soviet union unilaterally broke the pact of neutrality , sending troops into northeast china and defeating the kwantung army .
for things like this , as japan looks at this piece of history also , japanese captives were dragged to siberia to labor camps i heard there were 100,000 , 200,000 .
uh-huh .
well , there is also a nationalist sentiment issue also , including this , these have all been brought together .
therefore , unraveling this historical feud , the northern territories issue , is not so clear - cut , since history , society , and law , as well as nationalist sentiments are all entangled together .
yeah . just now you mentioned the origin of the four northern islands . well , today we have been talking about the four northern islands issue . well , how exactly did the four northern islands issue originate ? let 's learn something about it .
the four islands , iturup , shikotan , the khabomai rocks , and kunashir , are located in the northern part of the western pacific ocean , with a total area of about 5,000 square kilometers , which japan calls the four northern islands , and russia calls southern chishima .
their surrounding sea waters have a great wealth of fishing resources and undersea mineral deposits , with highly important strategic positions .
the ownership of these four islands has long been a dead knot in russian - japanese relations that has been difficult to untie .
in august 1945 , the us dropped atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in succession .
to ask the soviet union to declare war against japan , the us and britain gave russia the chishima islands and the southern part of sakhalin island , which japan occupied at the time .
in 1955 the soviet union and japan began negotiations regarding the normalization of relations .
the then soviet union indicated willingness to return the khabomai rocks and shikotan .
yet japan requested that the soviet union return iturup and kunashiri as well .
it also requested that the soviet union promise to attend the international peace conference to determine the ownership of sakhalin and the entire chishima islands . negotiations broke down as a result .
in 1956 , the then soviet union restated its willingness to return the khabomai rocks and shikotan .
japan again said that unless the four islands were returned together , the soviet proposal could definitely not be accepted .
for a long time , japanese - russian relations have not made breakthrough progress due to the deadlocked four northern islands issue .
today , already more than 50 years after the end of ww ii , the two nations have still not signed a peace treaty realizing the complete normalization of bilateral relations .
in the literal sense , if the two nations have not signed a peace treaty , it means at this point the two nations are still at war .
as the two experts are constantly discussing , saying that the four northern islands issue is a dead knot in japanese - russian relations , yet this dead knot , it seems that currently both sides have this idea , they want to untie this dead knot .
well , we noticed , er , just now this short clip also talked about it , at that time the soviet union agreed to return two islands first , but , but , eh , japan never agreed .
but now , we also notice that the japanese side again proposed , taro aso proposed a new idea , the joint development that the soviet union had previously talked about .
well , can this point lead to a breakthrough in the two nations ' resolution of the four northern islands issue ?
i think it is very hard , as joint development and sovereignty of the islands are , ah , two concepts .
it wo n't work , either , eh , eh .
but this is relevant .
uh-huh .
oh , as i just mentioned , it was against a large background that russia first proposed it .
uh-huh .
with quite a troubled economy , quite a troubled economy , russia needed japanese investment , needed japan to get involved through this channel .
uh-huh .
well , now that its economy has greatly improved , russia does not need to take this diplomatic risk .
uh-huh .
this is one . second , russia should be seen as a rather strong nation .
well , this place , the four northern islands , is a very sensitive region for the russian psyche .
any small , small diplomatic or economic action will affect the psyche of russian citizens .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , well , putin 's visit to japan this time , or during his visit to japan , or prior to this , there were rallies in the far east region , including the sakhalin area , meant to give many warnings to putin .
uh-huh .
well , russian politicians also made many appeals regarding this . well , one russian politician stated very clearly that while russia 's territory is vast , russia does not have territories to spare .
this is a very , very , eh , tough kind of issue .
well , as i just said very clearly , that is to say , in addition to the legal and historical complications , the repeated change of ownership , and then national sentiments as well , the four northern islands are also strategically very important .
that is , does n't russia advocate a double - headed eagle policy ?
right , right .
it is both a european and asian nation .
well , if he wants development in asia , wo n't he close the door if he loses hold of the four northern islands now ?
uh-huh .
fisheries .
the four northern islands not only have mineral deposits , oil , and fisheries , but also for military strategy , they are key positions in the pacific ocean .
in the pacific ocean , right .
currently russia seems to be in a period of low tide , but it wo n't stay this way forever .
right , right , right .
it is still a large nation . it is still a large nation . it is also an international power . therefore , none of its leaders can easily give away the four northern islands .
it , if it , let me again add some words , if it wants joint development , japanese companies and japanese influence will enter the four northern islands .
right , right .
well , after entering , economy , economic influence may lead to political influence .
currently that would seem to benefit japan .
yes . it would benefit japan . russia has foreseen the consequences .
that 's why russia now rejects it . it was originally proposed by russia , but rejected by japan .
uh-huh .
this is a new incarnation , but with different political significance .
uh-huh .
well , since the four northern islands issue is a dead knot in bilateral relations that can not be untied , and also both are working hard , yet with seemingly little hope in sight , well , how can japanese - russian relations develop under such circumstances ?
i think both sides generally know the two sides ' levels of political operations , knowing that territorial issues are hard to resolve .
so , with this issue having gone on for many years , both sides may have a bottom line .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that is , they wo n't say we will stay opposed to each other as long as it is unresolved .
uh-huh .
so it may be like this . that is to say , in the future both sides may become more reasonable on this issue .
that is , looking farther ahead , normalization of relations will still be gradually developed .
uh-huh .
that is , do n't always get stuck on the territorial issue .
but on the other hand , the territorial issue is also quite important and sensitive .
so it is unrealistic for you to say there will be breakthrough progress in japanese - russian relations and that their economic and trade relations will suddenly achieve 100 billion .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so the prospects for japanese - russian relations are not too good .
uh-huh .
that is , it will be a normal , that is , very common , very , relatively bland kind of relationship .
uh-huh .
that is , russian - japanese relations , from the perspective of russia , i do n't see many changes in the large framework of russian - japanese relations .
well , mr. xing , how do you view russian - japanese relations ?
that is to say , these basic tones have been set . the main issue is the four northern islands .
however , current signs show that russia and japan are moving forward on economic issues , on economic cooperation .
uh-huh .
yes . i will give two examples . one example is that this year toyota motor has invested in st. petersburg .
uh-huh .
in addition , putin attended the ribbon - cutting ceremony . this is quite , quite a clear signal .
that is to say , russia japan has now invested in russia .
second , what japan hopes to get is , hey , russia 's oil .
uh-huh .
though russia did not make a final commitment , there is already a general framework .
uh-huh .
that is to say , eventually russia 's oil pipeline will be connected to a pacific ocean port , which will benefit japan .
uh-huh .
that is , although there are obstacles in bilateral relations , they are still exploring forward movement .
right .
uh-huh .
okay , well , today we will end our discussion here on the topic of putin 's visit to japan .

this is cctv focus today .
a british newspaper revealed that the us had planned to bomb the al - jazeera tv station in qatar .
was this a joke told by us president bush or was it a long - meditated threat ?
did british prime minister blair know nothing about it , or did he succeed in persuading his ally to give up the idea of attacks ?
what exactly is the truth ?
why can a tv station in a small arab country have us president bush on pins and needles ?
focus today is coming up in a minute .
hello , dear viewers , welcome to focus today .
on november 22 , the british newspaper daily mirror revealed that us president bush once planned to bomb the al - jazeera tv station headquarters , setting off a mighty uproar .
the two british nationals charged with leaking the information already appeared in court for interrogation yesterday for the first time .
according to a report by the british newspaper the guardian , al - jazeera tv station is now considering suing us president bush for this matter .
well , what exactly was this incident ?
why has al - jazeera tv station become a thorn in bush 's side ?
these are all the topics we will be focusing on today .
two honorable guests have been invited to our studio . let me give you an introduction .
one is mr. ruan zongze , vice director of the china institute of international studies . mr. ruan zongze has done extensive researches on british and us issues .
the other is mr. wu huixuan , former cir chief correspondent based in qatar .
hello !
welcome you two to the studio for our interview .
well , at the start of today 's program , let 's learn about the full context of this incident together .
we will first talk about the daily mirror article that started it .
what we are seeing now on screen is a very popular newspaper in britain called the daily mirror .
next , let 's see this is a november 22 article .
the title goes like this
exclusive report bush planned to bomb his arab ally
well , let 's now look at the content of the article .
the article writes that the minutes of a meeting between british prime minister blair , who was visiting the us on april 16 , 2004 , and us president bush at the white house showed that bush had intended to take military actions against al - jazeera tv station headquartered in the qatari capital of doha .
then , blair said to bush that such an action would trigger a worldwide uproar .
these are some records of the conversation between the two men .
let 's now look at this article .
a paragraph in the article writes let 's look at this line marked with a black frame , which writes undoubtedly bush wanted to do this .
and equally without doubt , blair did not want him , that is , bush , to do this .
well , it happened , er , that our correspondent did an interview at the al - jazeera 's beijing office today and happened to videotape the image we are watching now , which was broadcast live by al - jazeera tv station . it was the news about bush 's plan to bomb al - jazeera tv station .
so we are seeing on screen was exactly transmitted by al - jazeera tv station .
well , yesterday the two british nationals involved in the disclosure of the incident were interrogated by the court . well , is the scene of the two persons under interrogation .
in the meantime , al - jazeera tv station also protested several times upon learning the information .
well , this is a brief introduction of the context of the incident .
well , regarding this topic , the first question today is that we want to find out clearly whether this incident was real or not .
let 's start with this newspaper .
well , director yuan , i know that you also once worked in britain . well , what kind of newspaper is the daily mirror ?
it is said to have a very large circulation , but people still call it a tabloid . so how accurate is the news carried by it ?
this is true . its circulation should be considered one of the largest among british newspapers .
uh-huh .
but at the same time , interestingly , it is not a mainstream newspaper , either .
uh-huh .
that is why it is called a tabloid , because it does not belong to the mainstream in the current british newspaper industry .
it is still called a tabloid .
it is placed together with other city newspapers , yet it is also a newspaper of national circulation with an extremely powerful influence .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
its influence is mainly on ordinary readers , the general public .
that 's because most british newspapers have their own steady readership .
they have different levels of readership , ah .
right , they have a fairly steady readership .
right .
well , this newspaper is said to have various kinds of topics appropriate to all ages .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
well , so , now we need to seriously consider its authenticity or accuracy .
is the news carried by it credible or not ?
how much is its accuracy , i think , is still quite hard to determine at this time , indeed ,
uh-huh .
because i will mainly speak from two perspectives . first , when the mirror got hold of the news , it called 10 downing street the first night , saying that it had such information .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
well , it meant to find out whether 10 downing street had anything to say , but downing street said it had no comments .
uh-huh .
however , when the news was released , it set off such a mighty uproar .
uh-huh .
this is the first point .
the second point is to look at the reaction of al - jazeera tv station . what al - jazeera tv station is now asking britain to do is to either confirm the news as true or to deny it .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
however , right now , britain has neither said it is true nor said it is not . that is the situation .
it did not confirm anything .
however , there is still one detail . when we introduced the context information , we also mentioned the two staff members involved in the leakage of the information . these two staff members , also considered british government employees , have already been under interrogation .
well , since they are under interrogation , it means they may have indeed divulged the secret .
could this be used to determine that there was indeed such an incident ?
there was such an incident , um , uh-huh .
i think there are two questions involved in this matter . one is whether there is any secret being divulged , and the other is whether the news that bush wanted to bomb al - jazeera tv station is true .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think these are two different questions .
uh-huh .
regarding the leakage of the secret , it seems that the possibility here , ah , is really big .
what secret exactly was divulged ?
um .
because according to the british , um , government , um , its official secrets act section 5 , that is to say , it is illegal for newspapers or media to publicize indiscreetly government information obtained through unauthorized channels .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , well , these two people have already been suspected of violating this section , and that is why they have been sued .
right .
well , of course it is still in a preliminary stage right now , and yesterday a hearing lasting only 15 minutes was held .
uh-huh .
but , both of these two people denied they were guilty .
uh-huh .
so , now it will still have to go through a quite lengthy judicial procedure .
eh , in other words , although they were interrogated , whether the secret leaked was something like our topic today , that is , bush said he wanted to bomb al - jazeera tv station , whether the secret divulged was this record , these are still two different things .
however , it should be closely related to this because this is about the so - called memo .
uh-huh .
it should be closely related .
yeah .
uh-huh .
on april 16 of last year when blair was visiting the us , they had some exchange between them . that was how this memo came into being . it was about five pages long .
right .
uh-huh .
well , in this memo , bush seemed to imply that he probably wanted to bomb this al - jazeera tv station .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
at that time blair tried his best to persuade him not to do it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , but the very authenticity of the incident , i think , still needs to be determined by the british government or us government .
they need to come out for making clarification and judgment .
yeah .
well , mr. wu , we know , ah , you worked as a reporter in qatar and were very familiar with al - jazeera tv station . so how do you look at this incident ? do you think it is real or not ?
um .
i think it is possible that the us wanted to bomb al - jazeera tv station .
uh-huh .
that 's because all the things reported by al - jazeera tv station since its establishment in 1996 were those the us did not want viewers in the world to look at , especially with respect to the afghan war and iraq war .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
what they reported was entirely incompatible with the so - called freedom of the press advocated by the us .
uh-huh .
for instance , the us attacked al - jazeera tv station several times .
it happened once that when bush , er , together with that defense secretary rumsfeld visited qatar , they put pressure , put pressure on the qatari government , saying you should not broadcast these news items that were harmful to the us .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , later , under such circumstances , eh , the director of al - jazeera tv station was replaced once .
uh-huh .
under his pressure .
uh-huh .
but , the leader of al - jazeera tv station , jazeera , ah , qatar replied that we advocate the same freedom of the press as the freedom of the press in your country and that our government has no right to interfere with what is being reported by a private tv station .
that is to say , eh , according to your judgment , this incident was possible because the us has long considered it a thorn in its flesh .
right .
so , to say that the us government or the us president had such an idea , you think many people may easily believe it .
yeah .
there is such possibility .
right , yes .
all right , regarding whether this incident was real or not , according to you two , eh , there is indeed a lot of information .
there are no waves without wind .
yeah .
right , there are no waves without wind . so , this incident probably does have some basis .
some basis .
well , let 's now focus on this al - jazeera tv station .
as a matter of fact , when we watch tv , we can see many news services , ah , including the us cnn and the british bbc , often replaying footage by al - jazeera tv station .
since the al - jazeera tv station logo is on , people should be quite familiar with al - jazeera tv station .
the station logo , right .
yeah .
but how did this al - jazeera tv station rise to fame competing with so many western media outlets in news coverage ?
let 's learn about this through another background video clip .
al - jazeera tv station , established in november 1996 in qatar , is an arabic - language news tv station broadcasting global news and reports nonstop around the clock . its staff all comes from various arab countries , and its viewership has reached 50 million .
prior to its establishment , there has been no arabic - language tv station broadcasting news nonstop around the clock in the arab world .
in september 2001 , the 9 / 11 attacks broke out in the us .
on october 7 , the us and britain launched military strikes on the taliban in afghanistan .
as a result , another news war erupted in the international media community .
when people all over the world expected to watch the live broadcast of the war by the us cnn , they could only see a few blurry images on tv .
meanwhile , however , the little known al - jazeera tv station based in the small gulf country of qatar suddenly emerged to broadcast the progress of the afghan war in arabic language and mobilized its 27 reporting stations all over the world to conduct an around - the - clock follow up coverage .
when the taliban regime announced that reporters from all countries were banned from entering the territory of afghanistan , al - jazeera tv station was the only one that could enter the taliban - controlled area .
taking such an advantage , al - jazeera tv station started to establish its unique leading position in covering the afghan war with its frequent live broadcast of missile attacks on the afghan capital of kabul .
during the war , al - jazeera tv station continued to broadcast exclusive news and images under its logo and sell them to competitors at the high price of 20,000 us dollars per minute .
while the us military searched everywhere for information on bin laden in vain , al - jazeera tv station frequently aired the footage of bin laden making a speech .
mr. wu , we know that you happened to be in qatar when al - jazeera tv station was just established in 1996 .
right .
in addition , you were said to have attended the inaugural broadcast ceremony .
what did al - jazeera tv station look like when it just started broadcasting ?
what kind of news broadcast style was featured at that time ?
er , they held an inaugural broadcast ceremony at the end of november 1996 at that time .
we reporters in qatar were also invited to attend this inaugural broadcast ceremony .
uh-huh .
there were n't many people at the time .
uh-huh .
but at the time of its establishment , this , er , al - jazeera tv station already had a very good foundation in terms of reporters .
uh-huh .
why ?
in 1995 , um , the british bbc 's arabic language tv station was shut down due to funding problems .
uh-huh .
so , al - jazeera tv station seized this opportunity to get hold of this , this entire group of people by hiring them , er , as their reporters , editors , or anchors at high salaries .
uh-huh .
so , they had a relatively good team of reporters .
uh-huh .
well , this way , later it followed that , er , er , three - chinese - character , three , er , six - chinese - character principle of news reporting called , er , independence , neutrality , ah , neutrality , balance , and freedom .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , what it reported was in a completely different style from that of some other arab tv stations .
right .
in this respect , that is , let me add one point , that is , this al - jazeera tv station , ah , its style is very much characterized by direct borrowing from the west , for instance , the two mainstream media outlets .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
one is cnn , and the other is bbc .
yeah .
well , i think that bbc , in particular , has quite a big influence on it .
just now mr. wu mentioned , that is to say , many of its reporters directly came from the middle east channel at that time .
uh-huh .
that was jointly run by bbc and saudi arabia . so it had a very good foundation .
in addition , that is , actually , this al - jazeera tv station has a quite unique structure .
that 's because the emir of this country is called hamad . he studied in britain and therefore had quite a good knowledge of britain 's bbc tv station . he also quite admired it .
so , in this way , it has borrowed some of the bbc style .
for instance , britain 's bbc is a very old tv group established in 1927 .
uh-huh .
though it is funded by the government with many of its properties owned by the government , it still follows the guideline of editorial independence .
uh-huh .
for instance , the top decision - making body of bbc is called the board of directors which are composed of twelve members directly appointed by the queen .
uh-huh .
so al - jazeera tv station has also adopted this structure . it has a top seven - member board of directors .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
however , even if its property , ah , and funds can come from the government , it still relatively has its editorial independence .
eh , but in essence , mr. wu , is it really a private tv station or a government - run tv station ?
er , they themselves claim that it is a private tv station , but in reality it could not have been established without a large amount of financial support given by the government .
that 's because it , eh , has an extremely small number of ads during its around the clock broadcast , ah , tv broadcast .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , in addition , it has such a large team , especially with high , high salaries , er , wages , and reporters based abroad , so many reporters abroad . if the government had not supported such expenditures , eh , it would be impossible for a private tv station to survive .
according to your knowledge , how much is its yearly expenditure ?
it was said that the yearly expenditures seem to be about 7 billion us dollars .
about 7 billion us dollars , that is equivalent to more than 50 billion rmb . we should say this is a very huge financial expenditure .
uh-huh .
extremely large .
yeah .
therefore , some people call it gaining voice but losing money because it has relatively small revenues due to few ads .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but it has a tremendous influence .
right .
so , it appears that it is still not bad in gaining voice as it does achieve some effect .
yeah .
ha .
well , speaking of its influence , we have also noticed that er , during the afghan war , er , because it has the exclusive interview right to enter afghanistan to conduct independent and exclusive interviews , we could say this is one of its advantages .
uh-huh .
it also presented an opportunity to it as well .
well , to the development of a tv station , both opportunity and real strength are actually very important .
well , as al - jazeera tv station has been able to develop into its current status , what do you think has it relied upon so that its competitiveness and influential power can surpass , even surpassed cnn and bbc during the iraq war ?
the greatest feature of al - jazeera tv station is that it is a small station that competes with large ones and has become well - known through wars .
that is , the reason why it can establish itself is that it first relied on the afghan war , and then (np=2 (dt the iraq war after the 9 / 11 .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , it made full use of these two opportunities .
in addition , as the iraq war occurred right in an arab country , everyone is very much concerned with what is going on in the war . so , this provides it with a large viewership , making it instantly famous .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
besides , it has a lot of resources , including its exclusive coverage right in afghanistan as you mentioned just now .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
in addition , al - jazeera tv station is actually quite unique in the arab region .
for instance , a very tough conflict in this region is the conflict between palestine and israel .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , in general , arabs will not invite the israeli leader to make a speech on their tv .
however , for al - jazeera tv station , it could invite barak , the israeli prime minister at that time , to deliver a speech at al - jazeera tv station . this was unprecedented in the arab world .
right .
uh-huh .
well , this also gave it a very unique perspective .
uh-huh .
so , the reason why it is successful , to put it simply , i think , is that it mainly relies on its own very professional news team .
it has a very talented team , eh .
yeah .
in addition , it also looks at major events as they happen from the unique perspective of the arab region or arab world .
uh-huh .
i think that favorable opportunities and geographical conditions also helped because people involved in the afghan war and the taliban were mostly arabs .
uh-huh .
they were from arab countries . they spoke the arabic language . well , that was the opportunity .
in particular , it was the same with the iraq , iraq war , which took place in iraq .
in the iraq , iraq war , as far as i know , among foreign media teams dispatched to iraq for coverage , i should say , the one from qatar 's al - jazeera tv station was the most powerful .
uh-huh .
it had three reporting stations at that time , one group in the south in basra , well , one group in baghdad , and still another group in the north in mosul .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so it was basically covering the iraq , um , iraq war from all perspectives .
so , it surely surpassed some western media in covering the iraq war in certain areas .
uh-huh .
we could say it owed its success to good opportunities , which it seized ;
yes .
favorable geographical conditions that is to say , it happens to be located geographically in the arab world ;
yeah .
and also harmonious human conditions that is to say , it has its own very rounded and talented team .
er , that is why it is highly influential and competitive .
however , as it is becoming more and more influential and competitive , it has also become a thorn in the us side .
well , today we should say we have just given an introduction of al - jazeera tv station .
well , next let 's learn about more .
what conflicts are there between al - jazeera tv station and the us ?
why has it become a thorn in the us side ?
since it gained instant fame during the afghan war , the style of al - jazeera tv station in pursuit of the freedom of the press and independence has gradually won widespread international attention .
however , at the same time , the conflict between al - jazeera tv station and the us has been increasing .
according to reports , bush , rumsfeld , and powell repeatedly expressed their strong displeasure with al - jazeera tv station directly to the qatari leaders , demanding its government to restrain it more firmly .
the us government thinks that radicals , anti-american and religious commentators have become frequent guests at al - jazeera tv station . in particular , bin laden has chosen it as his exclusive information release agency , endowing it with a unique advantage .
all these made the us hate and fear al - jazeera tv station at the same time .
officials of the bush administration called it osama 's tv station on different occasions because bin laden 's full name is osama bin laden .
during the iraq war , al - jazeera tv station not only broadcast bush 's and blair 's impassioned pre-war speeches and the image of coalition troops marching toward iraq , but also broadcast the bloody bodies of civilians next to bombed cars .
the video camera scanned over the corpses of coalition troops killed by the iraqi military , and over that little tearful boy with bandages around his head , crying .
if you see the war on the us tv as an electronic game and grand display of smoke and fire , then from the footage by al - jazeera tv station , you see the war only as hell .
do you still remember , ah , during the afghan war and the iraq war , we could often see on screen the al - jazeera footage such as bin laden and some other al - qaeda leaders giving speeches .
ah , moreover , the footage that many other tv stations were using also basically came from al - jazeera tv station .
therefore , at that time americans thought , said that since al - jazeera tv station broadcast these activities of terrorists , it must be colluding with terrorists .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , it was always thought that there seemed to be some subtle relationship between al - jazeera tv station and al - qaeda .
taciturn agreement .
taciturn agreement .
yeah .
taciturn agreement .
right , mr. wu , how do you look at this issue ?
this may have something to do with the good opportunities and favorable geographical conditions mentioned earlier .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
since , er , the taliban people were all arabs , they tried by various means to gain the information so as to expand their own influence .
this has been the consistent practice of al - jazeera station .
uh-huh .
well , the same goes with the iraq war .
they , eh , also speak arabic , right ? another arabic nationality .
uh-huh .
(sbar-nom-sbj-2 (whnp-1 (wp what they reported , eh , was very much welcomed and favored by %pw arab viewers .
uh-huh .
that 's because (sbar-nom-sbj-2 (whnp-1 (wp what they have reported can not be found in the western media reports . that 's why their fame grows .
that is to say , it indeed inspires a kind of patriotic or nationalistic sentiments among arab countries .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think this , this , this point is %pw very important .
in other words , it also benefits from the hard work of al - jazeera tv station .
that is , it is from the perspective of arabs that it looks at the war or also looks at major events .
so , when it makes a report , its perspective , analysis , and its possible outcome or some process of its analysis are different from those of reports by the western mainstream media such as cnn and bbc .
well , it is exactly because of this , even if al - jazeera tv station may not be necessarily linked with any other organizations , simply because it reports the war using a different voice , it has become the target of attacks by the us or the west .
right .
well , regarding this incident , what kind of reaction did al - jazeera tv station have ?
we do n't have much information right now .
but when our correspondents went to have an interview at the al - jazeera tv station 's beijing office today , they asked their office administrator named ezzat , ah , the question why the us threatened to bomb al - jazeera tv station ?
he is also a china expert and speaks excellent chinese .
let 's hear what he said .
i think the reason , er , is in the middle east region , in particular , currently , many , some us officials , for instance , many democrat officials , they admitted that the us policies on iraq and the middle east region , eh , region have many mistakes .
er , this point must be acknowledged .
however , up till now , er , the bush administration , it has not constant number , er , er , understood or realized they did not want to assume responsibility for what they have done there .
so , it wanted to blame its mistakes in this region on al - jazeera tv station .
second , it is because many some things are in conflict with its interests .
however , when i report , i do n't report for the sake of making somebody happy or not making somebody unhappy . this is not my principle , nor is my job .
some of the footage we broadcast did not conform to its interests . so it started to put this restrictive measure in retaliation .
so , the issue is not that al - jazeera tv station is making anti-american reports .
in addition , the us government is carrying out some measures and work against these people in the middle east region and against the world peace .
as you know , we were , eh , reporting the war in fallujah .
our reporter also , eh , almost had an accident there as several shots were purposely , er , fired at him .
then , in the end , er , secretary rumsfeld also directly blamed al - jazeera tv station .
er , who and who , er , most of what the reporter said , er , was groundless .
in the end , later , did we say anything later ? we stopped talking .
we then showed viewers facts and let the images speak by themselves .
we did not do anything at that time . our reporters were forced not to make any commentaries or any reports . we simply showed people the footage about fallujah .
well , the facts may not conform to the interests of mr. bush .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
in fact he mentioned a very important point of view here .
ah ,
uh-huh .
that is to say , this al - jazeera tv station , due to its unique perspective , is different from what is expected of it .
at al - jazeera tv station , there is one , one famous saying , that is , if the whole world listens to cnn , or the whole world watches cnn , then whom does cnn watch or listen to ?
that is also an issue of the right of speech .
well , in fact , the us has long been suppressing al - jazeera tv station .
for instance , the al jazeera tv station 's office in afghanistan was bombed in 2001 .
yeah .
uh-huh .
well , in 2003 , the al - jazeera tv station 's office in baghdad was also bombed .
on april 8 , its reporting station in baghdad was bombed , and one reporter was killed .
yeah .
right .
in addition , currently one of its reporters is still detained by the us at the guantanamo military base .
right .
eh , it was said that a sudanese correspondent from al - jazeera tv station , er , was arrested in afghanistan and has been detained ever since at this , er , us military base at guantanamo .
right .
yeah .
we could say that the us has been suppressing al - jazeera tv station for quite a long time .
yeah .
well , through what ezzat said himself , he also thought he was innocent .
uh-huh .
he basically also blamed it on the us .
well , will al - jazeera tv station really sue us president bush ?
will us president bush have any occasion or opportunity to have this matter clarified ?
would you please analyze how this incident will develop next .
i think that right now it is most likely because right now , it has actually entered into a certain judicial procedure in some sense .
uh-huh .
that is to say , the british judicial authority has already brought charges against these two officials , er , suspected of disclosing secret documents .
uh-huh .
well , now we have seen that the director of al - jazeera tv station has also flown to london to demand an explanation from blair .
uh-huh .
to bring up a lawsuit .
right ? that is , i think that right now it is more likely to stay for a while as a topic of public commentaries .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it will stay as a topic of public commentaries , because this involves if the us indeed had such a plan , then its so - called %pw , the freedom of speech it advocates will be again greatly discounted .
uh-huh .
we know that the us , like the west , they made a lot of efforts in controlling the right of speech in the international mainstream media .
this reminds me of the year 1999 . during the kosovo war , the us blew up the radio station of milosevic , the former yugoslavia .
uh-huh .
it indeed blew up this radio station of yugoslavia .
right .
then , later , the westerners themselves , including the us , admitted that the reason why it won the kosovo war was to a large extent that they won the other party in public opinion .
uh-huh .
it seems that this incident will again lead to a public opinion war .
uh-huh . after this incident was exposed , ah , al - jazeera tv station , tv station issued a statement last week .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the main idea of the statement was , eh , that al - jazeera tv station has always followed the principle of impartiality , neutrality , and balance in news coverage .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
for that purpose , it is now seriously investigating the news about the us plan to bomb the al - jazeera headquarters in reported by the us newspaper , ah , the british newspaper , and it hopes that the british government can explain this .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right , it seems that this incident , as it develops , will have a lot of things worthy of our attention .
however , as we are running out of time today , let 's end our discussion here .
thank you two very much for participating in our program .
thanks !
uh-huh .

(: -- basically , it was unanimously agreed upon by the various relevant parties .
to express its determination , the chinese securities regulatory department compares this stock reform to a die that has been cast .
it takes time to prove whether the stock reform can really meet expectations , and whether any deviations that arise during the stock reform can be promptly corrected .
dear viewers , the china news program will end here . this is xu li .
thank you everyone for watching . coming up is the focus today program hosted by wang shilin . good-bye , dear viewers .
hello , dear viewers . welcome to focus today .
today , let 's turn our attention to a road cave - in accident that happened in beijing over the holiday .
before dawn on january 3 , a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of jingguang bridge , east third ring road , beijing municipality , resulting in the road caving in .
relevant departments from beijing municipality promptly activated emergency contingency plans .
the traffic administration department carried out traffic supervision near the accident scene .
well , how did the emergency response mechanisms activated by governmental departments operate effectively during the holiday ?
after the holiday , what will be done to handle citizens ' peak commute ?
in addition , what measures did relevant departments take to resolve issues such as waste discharge , heating , and communication , in order to ensure that the lives of citizens were not affected ?
well , we have invited two honorable guests to the studio today to follow this topic with us .
one of the two honorable guests in the studio is professor zhou hanhua from the institute of law of the chinese academy of social sciences . hello .
(advp-tmp-prd-tpc-1 (rb next is yang yang , a host of beijing traffic radio station . hello .
welcome both of you to the studio to participate in our program .
well , i especially want to know , ha , how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident ?
ah , at 11:00 a.m. , about 11:00 m. yesterday , ah , i happened to find out through an sms when i was outside .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it happened that i was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at noon .
and then , the friend first sent me an sms , uh-huh . saying he would come pick me up to go together .
after that , i received an sms from 1860 .
uh-huh , it was through an sms .
and you , yang yang ?
a friend happened to call me .
you were not at work that day ?
no . the station called me at noon and said something happened at jingguang bridge and that i had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program .
uh-huh , that means , er , you found out the accident through an information source at the station .
right , right , right .
uh-huh .
well , like professor zhou , i also received this news , ha , through a mobile phone sms .
at that time , i , it can be said that this sms was among the many , ha , sms containing new year wishes , like happy new year , received after the start of the new year .
uh-huh .
ah , actually i felt a lot of warmth when i received that sms .
although we live in the west instead of the east and it did not affect us much , i think it is very useful , ah , to inform people of this kind of news .
yes , exceptionally .
yes , exceptionally .
well , what in fact was the content of that sms ? let 's take a look via this footage , ha .
i remember the sms was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of jingguang bridge at east third ring road , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near chaoyang road , jingguang bridge , and east third ring road , and requesting cars to make a detour .
some car owners said that it was very good that the sms was sent .
furthermore , there was one last sentence in that sms thanking citizens for their cooperation and support .
ah , after the sms was sent , i thought , i felt it seems to be the first time that beijing municipality , ah , used an sms to give notification at the time of a public emergency .
i do n't know , all of us are living in beijing , is this the first time , professor zhou ?
yes , in terms of an official notification , this should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860 .
uh-huh .
of course , in private life , people have used sms countless times to spread news .
yes .
other places in the country must have used this too .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
must have used this too .
actually , i remember receiving an sms like this one last year before it snowed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in beijing to a rather large extent .
uh-huh .
however , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time .
uh-huh .
ah , when an sms is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?
yes , this is indeed a point especially worth our through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by beijing municipality , uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply , worthy innovation .
uh-huh .
for instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone sms .
in fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e-government .
we usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .
yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the internet .
right .
it seemed that computers , ah , and the internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information .
well , presently in fact , e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last mile , ah , or last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic ids , and such as these , these , these electronic signatures . these are quite sophisticated forms .
uh-huh .
in particular , %pw more terminals , such as this , this cable television , ah , this , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone sms , are applied in e-government .
hence , i think this is an excellent , a test of e-government because , as i remember , during sars in 2003 , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of sars , ah .
uh-huh .
they said that e-government %pw was very good but was not put into use .
well , this time i think that a short sms like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form .
uh-huh .
yes .
we drive often in beijing , ha , yang yang .
if people were not informed of such a traffic accident through sms on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ?
yes .
ah , well , i think it would have been real paralysis . this is the most appropriate word to use .
furthermore , i think that when sms was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our china very well .
why is that so ?
this is because , it should be said that china is the country with the highest sms usage .
there are probably not as many chances to use sms in foreign countries compared with domestically , in china , ah .
so , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement .
yes , i noticed that many friends around me , around me received it . it seems that almost everyone received this sms .
yes .
yes .
the effect was extremely good , ha .
so , how exactly did citizens react ? let 's take a look at the reactions of citizens .
(: -- an sms . i saw it was that jingguang bridge .
hey , i say , this is quite good , quite good .
have you received information like this before ?
no , no . this was the first time .
the first time ?
yes , yes .
well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ?
quite fast . really quite fast , ah .
so , i did not drive today . i set out a bit earlier and took the subway here .
do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ?
ah , the response was quite fast .
in addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt .
colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and sms .
i think this plan was %pw quite speedy .
it seems that through this kind of sms , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha .
well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression .
let 's find out the situation at that time through some footage .
well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes .
well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the jingguang bridge at east third ring road .
all personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations .
see , through this footage , we see , ah , this --
uh-huh .
okay , ah , this , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at 4 o'clock .
that means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred .
well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .
well , ah , yang yang , you work at traffic radio station , ha , well , and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning .
a special program .
yes , a special program on this traffic .
so , let 's first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident .
judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ?
actually , concerning this , i think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in beijing .
previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in beijing .
that is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the jingguang bridge of the third ring road , it might cause the entire third ring road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods .
uh-huh .
it might even impact traffic on the second ring road and fourth ring road .
well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods .
well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from jingguang bridge to changhong bridge from the south all the way to guomao bridge , blocking the main and side roads .
well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone .
hence , at that time , before 6:30 a .m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried .
however , actually after the entire day today , i came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam .
uh-huh .
however , the affected area was not as large as expected .
moreover , some people made detours once they received the news .
right .
psychologically , people felt quite relieved .
because i know this situation .
right , like those whom we interviewed just now .
it was easy to handle once everyone understood .
yes , ah , one of the viewers we just interviewed mentioned just now , a citizen , he said , i set out today before the incident , and i did not drive after i was informed .
that person did not even drive .
right . actually , in this aspect , i think that citizens were really quite cooperative .
for instance , this evening , we had a , received an sms .
a friend said , i work on the 12th floor of the china world trade center at the guomao bridge , ah .
we were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .
later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the china world trade center .
right .
hey , he said this was quite a good idea .
actually , i think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect .
yes , many viewers , viewers not in beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred .
ah , we can take a look later through an animation .
this road represents a main road on east third ring road , with problems on both the main and side roads .
furthermore , chaoyang road is an intersection .
uh-huh .
whether it is chaoyang road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of east third ring road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of east third ring road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .
well , chaoyang road is a very important artery in the east - west direction .
yes .
when people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .
hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .
yes , actually i think everyone can see that from the buses that cross jingguang bridge .
yes .
as buses that cross the third ring road are currently , right now affected by the jingguang bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted .
uh-huh .
well , i think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .
if the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --
it is really like this , just look at the bus signs .
right .
have not seen so many buses .
right . its effect on people has been extremely extensive .
yes .
uh-huh .
well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ?
our correspondent specially interviewed director meng xianlong , mr. meng xianlong , of the command center of the beijing municipal traffic administration .
let 's hear what director meng said .
um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan .
in the roads close to where the problem emerged , we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends .
in this way , all vehicles going along east third ring road had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides .
east third ring road is a traffic artery in the east of beijing that links the north and the south .
in order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district , we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans .
we set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along east second ring road , east fourth ring road , west dawang road , ah , and related roads to the east and west , and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic .
it can be said that measures were very promptly taken .
ah , today is the first workday after the new year holiday .
well , what exactly was the situation this morning ? we specially sent a reporter to the scene this morning to shoot some footage .
let 's take a look at the situation this morning through this footage .
well , from this footage , we can see that , ha , at east third ring road , ah , near guanghua bridge , the roads here that lead to the vicinity of jingguang bridge have come under control and , well , various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations .
although the outdoor temperature in beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making detours .
well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly .
ah , it can be said , ah , yang yang , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mentality , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene .
uh-huh .
right , right .
you , through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?
actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone sms .
many of their friends since we know that jingguang bridge is located in the cbd district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work .
therefore , they sent sms saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus .
well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning .
we then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .
this shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind .
i think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mentality that beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations .
on the other hand , i think it can also fully show the level of people 's satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident .
that is , they think that the government has tried its best .
well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts .
uh-huh .
as such , in this regard , i think people 's mentality can become very calm .
uh-huh . well , professor zhou , from this perspective , is this one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ?
yes .
in terms of citizens ' mentality .
yes , in fact it can be seen from this particular case .
that is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .
we know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed .
time was lost .
well , yes , the state council has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms .
that is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do .
in this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed .
that is , in modern public management , ah , this is a very good case , that is , of shifting from a kind of unilateral administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between the government and the people .
i think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas .
yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .
traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this accident , cave - in accident occurred .
however , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects .
yes .
yang yang , do you know how many pipes there are underground ?
right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground . they include those like you just mentioned , as well as pipes like those for heating and communication , among others .
truly , these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens .
closely linked .
yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives .
let 's take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene .
ah , according to our understanding of the situation , the beijing municipal construction commission , ah , the communication commission , ah , and telecommunication , traffic , and other departments have assigned personnel to participate in emergency repair work .
relevant departments said that they will adopt a full range of measures to minimize the level of impact on people 's daily lives and work , in order to ensure stable order in society during the recovery period .
well , looking at the government 's response to this cave - in accident , ah , we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair , ah , because it involved various aspects of life .
well , ah , professor zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ?
yes .
this is also --
it is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .
yes , i think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the most , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries .
how many groups of people will be sent ? many groups .
yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .
it is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .
uh-huh .
how can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?
well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .
for instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .
however , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by beijing municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of beijing municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .
hence , i think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms .
uh-huh .
it was a very successful , er , response .
i think many good things can be summed up from this .
yes .
yang yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?
for instance , it is very cold during winter in beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently .
er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .
well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of beijing .
well , in this , in this regard , the chaoyang district government did a very good job .
after it received from the municipal government , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent electric heat , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .
it should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .
well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .
hence , over here , i think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households . i think (np-sbj-tpc-1 (prp it was done in a very humanitarian manner .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
professor zhou , actually for such a large scale city as beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .
yes .
i think it should be unexpected yet at the same time expectations .
for instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .
perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .
this is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .
it is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .
hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .
the critical thing is --
but the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .
yes .
yes .
yes , i think through a few incidents that happened in beijing municipality over recent years , such as sars , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at east third ring road this time , i think it can be seen that beijing municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time .
right .
it can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .
um , well , i think , yang yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .
yes .
because you often have this kind of direct sms exchange with listeners .
it is because , we , beijing traffic radio station , has become a part of emergency planning in beijing .
well , beijing traffic radio station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above .
well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by professor zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans . beijing municipality still had no emergency plan .
well , at that time , it happened that i was hosting the unblocked all the way program in the studio that evening .
well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .
ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .
it was not clear , it was very congested . you sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .
you could find out other news only by telephone . the various methods and channels were extremely unclear .
well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .
from our perspective as media , i think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .
yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .
yes .
it should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .
ah , apart from this , professor zhou , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ?
right , i think this gave us many revelations , ah .
first , i think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts .
this is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .
early warnings and forecasts .
yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism .
uh-huh .
it is not only for this , this , ah , this , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents .
uh-huh .
that is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up .
uh-huh .
in this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency .
uh-huh .
another thing i want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , i think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident responsibility , responsibility system .
in fact , there are , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .
for instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .
we have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others .
that is to say , we have many corresponding systems .
however , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases .
since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , i think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .
um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?
i think , in comparison to china , we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread . their level of development is more advanced than ours .
although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , i think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .
for instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .
with a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?
how can a safe , assured system be established ?
well , we need to learn and manage this .
uh-huh .
for instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast .
however , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized and , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility .
well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .
well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?
we know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people 's governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test .
well , how will they go undergo testing ? these also include some of our command and policy - making systems .
so , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , i think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems .
that is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities .
how can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?
%pw the state council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called one plan , three systems .
uh-huh .
(`` " one plan refers to the contingency plan , and (`` " three systems refers to systems of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .
so , i think we still have a lot of work to do in these three areas of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .
yes . well , finally , let 's turn our attention to handling of the situation , ah , during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in beijing .
traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now . well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes .
well , yang yang , based on your understanding , how long will it take ?
i think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes . this is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession .
therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress .
uh-huh .
this is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone . there is also an issue with many of the pipes below .
yes , the pipes below .
right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --
moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter .
yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster has already been added , has already been added .
but in the end , it requires time . hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature .
just now , you mentioned that there are many pipes , ah , for instance , there is a key heating pipeline . the first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time .
yes .
in addition , waste discharge is also very important .
waste discharged has currently blocked this up .
um , and , for instance , optical fibers , ah .
er , right now , if the optical fibers break , people in many households will not be able to watch television .
yes .
at present , we should not have a problem with watching television .
they are not broken .
it is just that , as the other pipes have to be repaired , the optical fibers have to be rearranged , to be hung up it seems .
after that , or it seems that a few steel pipes have been added below to make it %pw safer to walk across this section .
furthermore , let 's take water pipes as an example .
because they were exposed , the water pipes were not --
after that , yes , these were not damaged .
they were not damaged and this is quite normal .
um , there is no problem with water supply .
okay , well , today both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave - in accident in beijing municipality .
at the same time , you have also analyzed , from a system perspective , how the government has reinforced emergency contingency plans to handle such public emergency cases .
okay , thank you very much , professor zhou and yang yang , for coming to the studio to participate in our program . thank you , both of you .
okay , dear viewers , that is all for today 's edition of focus today . thank you for watching .
see you at the same time tomorrow .
hello . let 's turn our attention to the weather .
today , we can use two words to summarize the weather in our country .
first , there will be a temperature drop over a large area , and next , there will be rainfall and snowfall in an extensive area as well .
we see that except for some areas of south china , southwest china , and northeast china , many other places will be experiencing temperature drops .
in addition , there will be snowfall in the area from northwest china to the huang - huai area through southern north china .
the east of southwest china , as well as the jiang - huai area and the area south of the yangtze river , will experience continuous rainfall .
however , southern north china and the huang - huai area will bid farewell to the snow tonight , ah .
tomorrow during the day , snowfall in the jiang - huai area will stop , and there will also be less snow in northwest china .
in addition , there will be rain throughout almost the whole of south china .
it can be said that there will be less snow in the north and heavier rain in the south tomorrow .
furthermore , temperatures tomorrow in many places south of the huai river will fall by between four and ten degrees .
okay , let 's check out the city weather forecasts .
beijing , overcast changing to sunny , 9 degrees below zero to 2 degrees below zero .
harbin , sunny , 26 degrees below zero to 16 degrees below zero .
shijiazhuang , overcast changing to mostly cloudy , 9 degrees below zero to 1 degree below zero .

how many ups and downs can one woman have /?
this is news night /.
first of all 's a quick track of some of the stories we 're following tonight /.
president bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to help protect americans against the threat from bird flu /.
it includes stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million people /.
the president says there is no immediate threat but there is cause for concern /.
in washington tensions are high after an unsual senate session /.

republicans for their part are calling it a political stunt /.
and defense secretary donald rumsfeld says more american troops could soon be heading to iraq /.
he says they will be needed temporarily to prevent an expected increase in insurgent attacks ahead of iraq 's parliamentary election in december /.
but we begin tonight with an ongoing mystery /.
who is that lone man discovered last month frozen in california 's sierra nevada mountains with just a few tantalizing clues to his identity /?
this we do know at this hour /.
the man died more than sixty years ago /.
he was in the military apparently world war two airman /.
and while it looks like his plane crashed in the mountains did twenty - five other planes around the same time /.
thelma gutierrez went inside the forensic laboratory where scientists are trying to solve this mystery /.
an address book a plastic comb a vintage penny /.
you 're looking at the last things a young airman put into his pockets on the day he died clues to a world war two cold case that you 're about to see for the very first time /.
it is a mystery that begins high in the sierra nevada mountains at the bottom of a glacier /.
two weeks ago climbers discovered a frozen man face down in the snow still in his army air force uniform and an unopened silk parachute /.
after six decades the airman is exhumed from his icy tomb and thawed out /.
but he 's wearing no military dog tags or id /.
did this world war two pilot perish when his training flight crashed in the mountains like twenty - five other ill fated flights more than sixty years ago /?
the search for clues takes us to honolulu hawaii to the joint powmia accounting command or jpac /.
the mystery of the frozen airman is just one of more than a thousand different unsolved cases that scientists here at jpac are trying to solve /.
in this laboratory alone i 'm surrounded by the remains of at least twenty different service members who are in the process of being identified so that they too can go home /.
the investigation begins with a team of forensic specialists who probe and study the airman 's bones teeth and his belongings to piece together who he is /.
and almost immediately clues begin to surface /.
dr. robert mann a forensic anthropologist has determined that the airman was caucasian and had fair hair /.
next though i 've got i 'm going to have to look at his his clavicles /.
the airman 's collar bones and pelvic bones prove that he was in his twenties and died in an airplane crash /.
this is a person who likely died on impact versus perhaps freezing to death up in the mountains /.
i think that the uh the injuries were so substantial um and severe that it it wo- he would n't have felt anything /.
he would have died immediately /.
one two /-
another important clue /.
he has a significant number of uh fillings /.
like the bones xrays of his wisdom teeth also tell us something about his age /.
root tips are are closed /.
they 're sealed up which is more indicative of someone who would be at least twenty - one years old /.
and dr. andy henry notices something else /.
the airmen have straight teeth /.
so he had a nice smile good teeth /.
yes i would have to say that yes /.
then there are the material clues the things he had on him when he died that offer a snapshot into who he could have been /.
if there 's a badge or anything else that /-
we know he was wearing a world war two army air force uniform /.
remnants of his sweater undergarments and socks are still intact /.
and more clues emerge from his tattered uniform a corroded nameplate this pin on his collar and this army aircorps insignia /.
when i found these insignia i was happy to see them /.
and our young white - haired airman also carried this black comb and some pocket change forty - five cents worth /.
some of these dimes are in ranging from nineteen thirty - six to nineteen forty - two /.
in his uniform breast pocket dr. paul emanovsky found this vintage schafer pen and three small leatherbound address books /.
the pages have been decomposing /.
but could they contain names of friends and loved ones /?
and we 're going to put it in a spectral comparator /.
at first nothing /.
then like magic clues begin to emerge /.
uh you can see all these letters from the calendar sunday monday tuesday up at the top one nine four and two /.
nineteen forty - two /.
yeah /.
after hours of meticulous examination of each address book they yield no personal information clues that could have faded with time /.
and so while we still do not know who our twenty - something fair - haired airman is enormous progress has been made /.
out of the thousands of unidentified world war two service members dr. mann says they 've narrowed it down to just ten /.
so what was it like to grow up there /?
in pleasant grove we recently met these three sisters all in their eighties who have high hopes that the frozen airman proves to be their big brother glen munn whose plane went missing in the sierra back in nineteen forty - two /.
oh i just wanted the final you know to know that he was found and that we can have him brought home here to for burial and /-
we do n't know that though /.
we do n't /.
but that 's my wishes /.
and until they learn otherwise they say they will keep that hope alive /.
and in the weeks and months ahead scientists are convinced they will identify this airman and return him home to his family wherever they might be /.
thelma gutierrez cnn honolulu hawaii /.
and there are some new developments to talk about tonight /.
scientists may be even closer to solving the mystery /.
for an update we 're joined by dr. robert mann one of the senior scientists you just saw working on this cold case /.
thanks for spending time with us tonight doctor /.
we understand since thelma left your laboratories you 've now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.
is that true /?
well hi paula /.
yes we have /.
uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago our analysts and historians got to work on that /.
and they were able to wittle it down the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.
and at this point they 've wittled it down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.
so we 've gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.
so how much easier will that make it for you to unlock this case , do you think /?
well i think it 'll help quite a bit /.
um any time you 've got a a body uh or remains like this that has come in and they 're in pretty good condition such as this one is , it 's mummified remains /.
we have some soft tissue we can deal with /.
so we can look at the color of the hair /.
we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.
but then there are other things that are hidden beneath the soft tissue that are revealed only in the skeleton /.
and that 's where we 're going to now /.
so in the interest of full disclosure what i know about forensics is basically what i 've learned on csi /.
and one would think that because you 've got it now narrowed down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try to do a potential dna match with what you 've found in the ice /.
is it not that simple /?
well no no it 's not that simple /.
um one thing we always caution people about is the pool of of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what we 're looking at /.
and what we want to do is we do n't want to just look at the material evidence that we have and immediately make a um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.
what we want to do is have the evidence speak for itself /.
and when we look at this individual we 've done as we 've done the biological profile looking at his remains his bones his teeth and the material evidence /.
and what we 're able to tell from this individual is that he is he died in his twenties he stood somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um he sustained massive trauma to his body on impact /.
and we have he 's caucasoid male /.
and so we know much more now just one week later than what we did when he came in about eight days ago /.
so the most important question is when do you think you 're going to know exactly who he is /?
well that 's the most commonly asked question that we have /.
and you know the reality is nobody can give you the answer /.
nobody knows for sure exactly when we 'll identify him /.
what it depends on is that all the lines of evidence come together for successful identification /.
if i were to give my best opinion in this it would be a few weeks to a few months /.
well we 'll be keeping our fingers crossed for you /.
know how hard you all are working in the lab there dr. mann /.
thank you for spending some time with us tonight /.
thank you paula /.
thank you /.
we 're going to turn now to some of the other stories in our world tonight /.
(advp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (rb here 's erica hill from headline news /.

his mother claimed her son wanted to be buried in california where she lived /.
but the judge says her testimony was quote forced and contrived /.
austin texas republican congressman tom delay gets his way /.
the judge scheduled to preside over his trial was removed from the case today /.
delay 's attorneys heads off the recusal because they questioned the judge 's impartiality since he had contributed to democratic causes /.
delay is charged with money laundering and conspiracy /.
he has pleaded not guilty /.
in washington the federal reserve once again raising a key short term interest rate by a quarter percent /.

today britain 's prince charles and his wife camilla laid flowers at the world trade center site in new york and then dedicated a nearby memorial to british victims of the nine eleven attack /.
it is the first stop on their eight day trip across the united states paula /.
and i 'm sure i 'll be hearing a little bit more about it all week /.
yeah erica i actually um bumped into them along with three hundred of their closest friends earlier tonight on th- their last stop of the day here in new york /.
and they were uh uh uh amazingly casual and accessible /.
we were all quite surprised /.
that 's good to hear /.
thanks erica /.
see you a little bit later on /.
and still to come on news night tonight the saddest post-katrina stories were those of the eldery who died in hospitals and nursing homes /.
now there are thirteen investigations into why and how such tragedies happened /.
and supermodels are n't the only ones to whom weight matters /.
jockies also may go too far to stay thin much too far /.
when at my worst i was heaving three or five to six seven times a day /.
starving to stay thin that and more still to come on news night /.
they happen to be the most vulnerable of hurricane victims the elderly many desperately ill living in nursing homes their fate in the hands of others /.
dozens died /.
there are at least thirteen investigations now underway /.
and at some nursing homes the failure to evacuate cost lives /.
in other cases it was the evacuation itself that proved fatal /.
(advp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (rb here 's keith oppenheim /.
my mother was thelma wahl /.
she was ninety years old /.
she was a very good mother /.
she was at huntingdon because she needed care /.
priscilla scott is mourning /.
her ninety year old mother thelma wahl was a resident of the huntingdon place nursing home in chalmette outside new orleans /.
priscilla says thelma wahl had serious osteoperosis fractures in her vertebrae but says thelma was not on the verge of death /.
on sunday august twenty - eighth the day before hurricane katrina struck the nursing home decided to evacuate patients /.
they waited too late to make the decision /.
priscilla says her mother should have been transported by ambulance /.
instead she says her mother sat on a school bus for twelve hours to lafayette louisiana normally a three hour trip /.
she says police told her there was no air conditioning /.
police declined comment /.
the owner of the nursing home thelma wahl was being taken to tells us by the time the bus arrived thelma wahl was dead /.
i feel like that uh the bus is what did it to her /.
she was alive when she left that nursing home /.
but she n- was not alive when she got to the lafayette area /.
cnn made repeated attempts to contact administrators or representatives of huntingdon place /.
but either we could not make contact or our calls were not returned /.
but staff for the louisiana attorney general 's office did speak to us by phone and confirmed that the matter of just what happened to thelma wahl when she was transported from this facility is under investigation /.
after dozens of patients died in the wake of hurricane katrina nursing homes have been under scrutiny /.
thirty - four patients were left behind at saint rita 's nursing home in new orleans when katrina hit /.
they all died in the flood /.
the owners were charged with negligent homicide /.
the county coroner says he urged saint rita 's to move its patients /.
they insisted several patients were too fragile to move /.
before hurricane rita a busload of nursing home residents were being evacuated from houston /.
but during the ride a fire from a back wheel accelerated because of oxygen canisters patients on board were using /.
twenty - three people died /.
federal officials are investigating /.
no charges have been filed /.
joe dodges executive director of the louisiana nursing home association says when it comes to evacuations elder care facilities are damned if they do and damned if they do n't /.
walk a mile in our shoes that 's all i have to say because anybody anybody who works in a nursing home will very quickly learn that these are very fragile patients /.
we did the very best we could in these situations /.
we 've got /-
dodges says the reality is old sick patients are always in jeopardy when a hurricane strikes a dilemma made worse by massive traffic jams during pre-storm evacuations /.
i mean if they 're on a bus for nine or twelve hours there 's a good chance someone 's going to die unfortunately /.
certainly it 's a very very difficult question to answer should i evacuate /?
jeff meitrod and steve riddyah write for the times picayune new orleans ' daily newspaper /.
they say nursing homes had to make tough calls /.
but last spring in a series of stories called state of neglect they reported that louisiana 's nursing homes are often poorly run and poorly regulated /.
nursing homes that kill residents nursing homes that um seriously injure patients um because of bad care /.
uh and the state does n't really do very much about it /.
and so nursing home owners know that in a lot of cases it 's less expensive to break the rules and to hurt people than it is to provide the level of care that /-
huntington place was criticized in the articles and has had several law suits brought against it /.
but it had a good inspection record /.
priscilla scott says she is trying to contact the nursing home owners but has n't been able to find them /.
she feels even if they had to make a tough call they owe her a better explanation as to why her mother died /.
keith oppenheim cnn new orleans /.
it still is n't clear why huntington evacuated thelma wahl by bus rather than by ambulance /.
but officials have said there were not enough ambulances to take care of everyone in the region /.
tomorrow night i will have a special report on a struggle that affects more than ten million americans including one million men the struggle with eating disorders anorexia and bulimia /.
as i just said it 's not just women and girls who are affected /.
men too struggle with these disorders /.
and i interviewed one of the nation 's top jockies shane sellers about the battle he waged everyday to control his weight /.
in the morning i 'd get up and take a diet pill um drink a cup of coffee and um and then head out to the race track and /-
with no food in your stomach /.
no food in my stomach no /.
and um you know you go and see the trainers and work your horses in the morning that you have to work /.
um by ten o'clock you 're finished uh i- /-
were you hungry at this point /?
oh i 'm starving you know /.
i mean i went to bed with nothing in my stomach either /.
maybe just a you know just a piece of ham or s- /-
you know just grab something to put in my stomach before i went to bed and um and and head to the to the track and maybe lay down for an hour and then uh head to the hotbox with uh for for a couple hours four or five pounds of water /.
the hotbox is a sauna a fixture in almost every jockey locker room /.
the hotbox sweatbox /.
sellers would often spend two hours inside pooling or sweating off extra pounds /.
and are you miserable the whole time you 're in there /?
oh it 's horrible /.
you have to be very weak /.
weak /.
ca n't have nothing /.
yeah you 're already di- dehydrated you know /?
so for more than twenty years you went through this process of basically not eating anything during the day sitting in the sauna a couple hours a day sweating two or three pounds off getting back on your horses training and maybe maybe having a piece of ham /.
and that 's all you had to sustain you /.
if i did eat anything sometime , when at my worst i was heaving three or f- five to six seven times a day i was heaving /.
jockies call it heaving or flipping /.
doctors would call it bulimia /.
overcome by hunger pains sellers would eat massive amounts of food and then throw it up to make weight /.
he says a tour of a jockey locker room shows you just how easy and accepted it was /.
these are regular toilets /.
and this is what they call a heaving /.
this is where they heave /.
you know it 's a it 's a much different type of commode /.
i do n't know it 's not i do n't know if it was especially made to for that purpose /.
but it 's it 's sure not the same as the other /.
and that 's what we used it for /.
is it true that some of you got so efficient at flipping that you could actually do it without putting your finger down your throat /.
i was one /.
jockey shane sellers just one of the many people you 'll meet tomorrow night in walking the thin line /.
it is a special edition of paula zahn now that gets underway at eight pm eastern /.
still to come on news night tonight the senate shuts down the doors clears the gallery /.
was today 's rare closed session needed to gaurd national secrets /.
or was it a political forum /.
and the president wants billions to help fight a possible bird flu pandemic /.
sounds like a lot of money /.
but will it actually be enough /?
also tonight rap star fifty cent may be at the top of the charts /.
but one la neighborhood is n't buying it /.
we ca n't say how those who will be voting on samuel alito 's nomination to supreme court feel about him /.
but we ca- s- we can say something about how you feel tonight /.
here are the results of the cnn usa today gallup poll released just minutes ago of those asked about the president 's choice judge alito to succeed justice sandra day o'connor /.
seventeen percent said he 's an excellent choice /.
twenty - six percent called him a good choice /.
twenty - two percent rated him only fair /.
seventeen percent thought he was a poor choice /.
questions about the facts or what were presented as facts that led the united states into the war in iraq spilled into open warfare today on the senate floor /.
democrats forced the senate into a rare closed door session /.
republican leader bill frist said the senate was hijacked /.
cnn 's ed henry was there /.
a democratic sneak attack that sent shock waves through the senate /.
mr. president enough time has gone by /.
i demand on behalf of the american people that we understand why these investigations are n't being conducted /.
democratic leader harry reed accused republicans of failing to probe allegations the white house manipulated intelligence to justify the war in iraq /.
and in accordance with rule twenty - one i now move that senate go into closed session /.
president i second the motion /.
an easy but rare maneuver with extraordinary consequences /.
the senate chamber was locked down , cameras shut off , so law makers could go into secret session to debate /.
republican leader bill frist was enraged /.
not with the previous democratic leader or or the current democratic leader have ever i been slapped in the face with such an affront to the leadership of this grand institution /.
there has been at least consideration for the other side of the aisle before a stunt /.
and this is a pure stunt /.
reed refused to back down demanding the republican led intelligence committee finish a long awaited report on whether the bush administration twisted intelligence /.
this investigation has been stymied stopped , thrown up every step of the way /.
that 's the real slap in the face /.
that 's the slap in the face /.
and today the american people are going to see a little bit of light /.
what 's really going on is democrats feel emboldened by the indictment of vice president cheney 's former chief of staff believing this is their chance to issue a broader indictment of the bush administration /.
we have lost over two thousand of our best and bravest /.
over fifteen thousand have been seriously wounded /.
we are spending more than six million dollars a month with no end in sight /.
and this republican led senate intelligence committee refuses to even ask the hard questions about the misinformation /-
republicans insist they 're completing the investigation /.
and this is just a distraction /.
this is purely political /.
this is settling settling an old political score /.
democrats say they also want to signal they 're ready to stand up to the republican majority and may even filibuster the president 's latest supreme court pick samuel alito a move that would make these events seem like the opening fireworks in a much nastier battle /.
ed henry cnn capitol hill /.
so do you think we just saw the outlines to what the midterm election battlelines might look like /?
a debate that 's likely to rage on for many many months to come /.
turning our attention now to something that has a lot of folks concerned /.
you 've been hearing an awful lot about avian or bird flu /.
the most common and deadly form has already spread in birds from south asia to europe /.
and now there is real concern that the virus could mutate and become devastating to humans /.
in fact some health experts say it 's just a matter of time /.
today president bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to prepare for a possible flu pandemic /.
now much of that money would go toward stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million healthcare workers and other first responders speeding up production of vaccines and buying the anti-viral drugs tamoflu and rolenzo which in some cases prevent flu infection /.
and we now turn to senior medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupto who has just gotten back from south asia where bird flu has in the past two years killed at least sixty - two people about half of those who were struck with it /.
hundreds of millions of birds around the world have been destroyed to try to contain the disease /.
and dr. gupto now just joins us from the emory university hospital in atlanta /.
always good to see you doctor /.
so /-
thanks /.
i know you 've had a chance to study the the plan the president put forth today /.
does it go far enough in your estimation /?
you know what 's sort of interesting paula /.
on one hand it is it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet /.
pandemic flu does n't exist yet /.
but a lot of people are talking about it /.
and i think that 's remarkable to a lot of people who are eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.
on the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.
the other thing paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that our- we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of icus a lot of icus in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients /.
the problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those icu rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic paula /.
uh let 's talk about the other problem of the plan where the president will spend uh or wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like tamaflu and rolenza /.
do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself /?
here 's the important thing about that /.
we do n't know for sure /.
a lot of people focusing a lot of energy on tamaflu and rolenza /.
these are antiviral drugs /.
they are not vaccines /.
they are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact /.
but we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.
the way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu /.
and nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons /.
so it 's just theoretical really for the most part that those will work paula /.
dr. sanjay gupto thanks for the update /.
by the way are you catching a cold /?
a a little bit /.
you know i just got back /.
and the ninteen hour plane ride /.
not bird flu though /.
i can assure you that paula /.
chicken soup /.
that 's right /.
just what the doctor ordered /.
works all the time /.
yeah right /.
i made a free house call for you doctor /.
coming up on news night tonight , cooking a turkey is fine /.
appearing in one is n't /.
will her nielson do to martha stewart what her prison time did n't /?
rapper fifty cents or fitty cent as some of you say sells millions of records /.
but one neighborhood does n't like the sales pitch /.
they call him fitty cent /.
but he is worth millions /.
his music like the gold single pimp may come straight from violent inner city streets /.
but suburban kids from coast to coast love the heavy base beat /.
the music sells /.
but not everyone is buying the message /.
savela vargas reports /.
fitty cent 's film get rich or die trying has n't even hit theaters yet /.
but its marketing has already enraged people in south central los angeles /.
since two thousand there have been eight hundred homicides in this community /.
now who wants to uphold that standard /?
who wants to keep perpetrating that madness /?
the movie 's billboard shows the rapper in a crucifixion - like pose brandishing a microphone in one hand and gun in the other /.
paramount you are doing damage to our community /.
you are doing an injustice to our community /.
and you committing violence in our community /.
and that includes fifty cent too /.
it must go /.
and go it did /.
a day after about twenty five people rallied in hyde park paramount pulled one sign down and since has pulled about half a dozen others near la area schools /.
i think what happens oftentimes people are so overwhelmed in communities particularly african american communities by say an image in this case hollywood /.
it just seems so big /.
it just seems so overwhelming /.
it 's almost like can we really fight city hall /?
whatever we 're going to do no matter how much outrage and anger that we express it 's not going to change anything /.
but in this case that was shown that that 's not the case /.
a paramount spokesman says the company is reviewing billboards in other locations /.
now similar complaints are coming from brooklyn new york /.
back in la the image hits too close to home /.
not too long ago we was over here /.
and and a guy just pulled out a gun and was shooting right in front of my daughter /.
we did n't come back for a week cause i was scared and she was /.
so i mean that right there it enraged me /.
not a good message /.
no it 's already enough gang violence out here /.
we do n't need that /.
cynthia levas director of golden day preschool thinks the billboard touched a nerve because many children here are fitty cent fans /.
when it comes to abc they be like a b /.
and they you have to wait for the other letters /.
but fitty cent song they can sing that word for word /.
rapper fitty cent whose real name is curtis jackson says it was ludicrous to single out his poster /.
you got to look at how often we put out action films and other films that utilize weapons as a marketing tool /.
we 'll find guns or weapons on the cover of of films probably more often than we 'll find people 's faces /.
he thinks the controversy will lead the film to greater box office success /.
but to the members of this community the victory is knowing that somebody listened /.
man they heard us /.
they heard our voice /.
and i 'm glad /.
i mean they i mean usually in this area nobody really cares /.
so for them to care about how we feel and how you know we raising our kids that that meant a lot to all of us /.
so i 'm happy /.
savela vargas cnn los angeles /.
and still ahead on news night /.
i carry this little packet my kid gave me /.
see what my daughter /-
daddy i love you /.
i miss you /.
be safe /.
come home asap /.
danger on the ground in iraq and under it /.
ied improvised explosive devices take a terrible toll /.
and prison barely dented her popularity /.
but can martha stewart survive her primetime ratings /?
everyday in iraq us soldiers work very hard to reassure local civilians train the iraqi army and stay alive /.
but with the increasing power of improvised explosive devices ieds staying alive takes a lot of training and time /.
eddie shrahmin is imbedded with american soldiers in northern bavil province /.
as the uh informants /-
come here strovell /.
listen up please /.
like the soldiers he commands lieutenant colonel ross brown suits up daily trying to rid his area of roadside bombs /.
whenever you roll out of the gate and you 're and you 're out there operating you never know if you 're going to hit one of these or not /.
the first stop today is route tampa some of the worst stretch of highway in what is called the triangle of death /.
salaam alakum /.
where these stall owners brown told are aware of impending attacks /.
did you know in advance that the ied was going to go off here /?
/.
tell him to look me in the eye /.
/.
tell me that again /.
/.
it is a fine line to walk routing out information without creating new enemies battling an insurgency that kills at will , that turns civilians into accomplices /.
i think they 're scared to death /.
i think they see us as temporary and they got to live with those people forever /.
finding friends locally seems the toughest part of brown 's strategy /.
but his next task proves just as difficult /.
here the lieutenant colonel has stopped at one of the firm bases one of the areas that iraqis are manning their own position /.
the commander on duty emerges out of uniform /.
and the lieutenant colonel struggles to find progress /.
they worked they did n't do too much work yesterday /.
they did n't do too much work the day before /.
they have n't done too much work since they 've been here /.
/. brown is unsure if this unit can survive an insurgent attack uncertainties shared by the us forces as well each soldier with his own way to cope /.
hey morales you carry anything special with you on missions to help you out /?
well i carry my wedding ring a bracelet my wife sent me /-
i carry a bible psalms ninety - one /.
a picture of an angel an archangel /.
i carry this little packet my kid gave me /.
see what my daughter /-
daddy i love you /.
i miss you /.
be safe /.
come home asap /?
is n't that cool /?
all right let 's go /.
overhead helicopters are responding to an ied attack that moments ago killed colonel william wood the highest ranking us officer to die in combat in iraq a personal friend of brown 's an added personal reason why tomorrow he 'll be suiting up again /.
eddie shrahmin cnn northern bavil province /.
and we turn our attention now to london where a memorial service was held today for the fifty - two victims of the bomb attacks in the city 's public transport systems back in july /.
queen elizabeth and prime minister tony blair attended as did relatives to those who died and emergency workers who responded to the terrorist attacks /.
andrew carey has the story of three firefighters who were first on the scene at one of the bombings /.
a major incident in central london /-
four explosions ripping through the subway s- /-
chaos on services with some passengers trapped underground /.
it began as an- any other day you know just uh doing eh normal checks /.
at nine o'clock we started our shift /.
and so the bells went /.
it was about a minute past nine when we got the shout for uh smoke issuing in allgate tube station /.
the explosion at allgate was the first of the four bombs to go off on july the seventh at eight fifty in the morning /.
but paul kelly steve sodbury and mel anderson of shadwell firestation 's blue watch had no idea what had happened as they got into the fire engine to answer the call /.
on the arrival at allgate we saw dozens of casualties outside the front sitting down /. and and it looked so serious that i for one second i thought this must be like a training exercise /.
these people had flesh injuries /.
but they also had psychological injuries /.
they just needed reassurance /.
they just needed reassurance because a lot of them were scared /.
it always happens to someone else on the television a terrorist incident /.
as medical teams arrived at the scene steve paul and two other firefighters went into the station /.
this scene of walking down down the platform and down the tracks with lines of injured people walking past you out the other way is /-
i 'll remember it forever i think /.
by the time they reached the second carriage they knew they were dealing with a bomb explosion /.
carnage /.
a man sitting down next door he had half his leg /.
there was um what i a person lying down /.
there was like a half a torso in front of the carriage as you go in /.
it sounds very harsh to say now /.
but when you 're down there and you 're dealing with it it kind of just happens /.
you go into autopilot /.
and you you look /.
and you think i ca n't help that person /.
let 's move on to the next one /.
eight people including the bomber died at allgate /.
one hundred and twenty were injured /.
at the end of the day back home with their loved ones a time for the firefighters to reflect and some mixed emotions /.
to them it was their happiness to see me walking through the door /.
but i knew that somewhere someone 's daughter was n't coming home , their father was n't coming home /.
watching it on the news is completely different to to looking in the eyes of a wounded person /.
as a fire brigade you 're there to rescue them /.
so it 'll always be a sense of regret as we did as much as we could but there was still a human cost and there 's nothing that we 'll ever be able to do about it /.
andrew carey cnn london /.
a producer from our london bureau /.
still to come the ups and downs of martha stewart and the british are coming ! the british are coming ! no wait /.
are n't they already here /?
but does anyone really care /?
and now we 're going to take a look at the trials and tribulations of martha stewart /.
you might have thought serving time in prison was tough /.
as it turns out , being on the outside might be even tougher /.
it seems like just yesterday martha stewart was sprung from prison and poised for her comeback /.
this is a country where we we believe in second acts , we believe in redemption , we believe in confessional stories , we believe in the comeback , we 've /-
five months behind bars had n't dimmed martha 's image /.
if anything it was soaring /.
along with her company stock it doubled during that time /.
martha once again took the helm of her company and her magazine /.
she also landed a starring role in the spinoff of one of tv 's hottest reality shows the apprentice /.
martha the woman everyone loves to hate was loved /.
it 's really wonderful to be back /.
i 've missed you as you can imagine /.
but what a difference a tv show makes especialy when that show is a flop /.
i 'm looking for the apprentice /.
the apprentice martha stewart debuted in september /.
her ratings tanked /.
and her stock followed suit plunging about forty - seven percent since her release from prison in march /.
once again martha stewart is persona non grata /.
even her friend and fellow apprentice star donald trump made it clear that her show was not a good thing /.
he had this to say in a recent radio interview /.
i think there was confusion between martha 's apprentice and mine /.
and mine continues to do well /.
and the other has struggled very severely /.
i think it probably hurt mine /.
and i sort of predicted that it would /.
you 're fired /.
ouch smackdown from the donald /.
donald /?
martha stewart punched back in a recent fortune magazine interview saying she was actually told that she would be firing the donald /.
is the old martha back again /?
she has a track record of being associated unfortunately with the b word and not a little b but a capital b /.
can the comeback queen come back again /?
i think she can be saved /.
anybody can be saved /.
any organization can be saved /.
but it takes a lot of hard work /.
is n't that one of the reasons for our infatuation with martha /?
she 's the perennial story of celebrity redemption /.
she said this to fortune magazine i have learned that i really can not be destroyed /.
apparently martha stewart is betting on her own comeback as well /.
we 'll see /.
still to come on news night the prince and his brand new wife making their first trip to the us since their marriage /.
this time it 's not exactly a fairy tale /.
this week americans are getting a rare chance to treat royalty well like royalty /.
prince charles and his new wife camilla have jumped across the pond and are touring the united states making their first stop today in new york /.
it 's charles ' first opportunity to showcase his new wife /.

but when it comes to camilla gossip columnists can get pretty catty /.
we 're all welcoming the prince and the duchess or mistress of whatever she is this week /.
a lone protestor parked herself outside the un where charles would later visit /.
camilla you are no princess said her sign with a horse on it /.
the horse is basically camilla /.
we all know that she 's a horse /.
she does n't belong here /.
and she 'll never be able to take diana 's place ever /.

in fact when i asked the sheriff exactly how many people were here he said he could n't really tell me that it 's just that he gave me the the county at large but there were thirteen hundred students here at the school /.
this is the one big high school for this county /.
so not many people at all /.
everyone knew uh the people at this school particularly this administrator and assitant principal ken bruce /.
students tonight saying he was very well - liked very approachable the kind of teacher who would actually give you lunch money if you forgot to bring it with you that day /.
so they 're talking about him tonight /.
they 're going to be missing him very much in the future anderson /.
about a little after two o'clock today a fifteen year old student wielding a hand gun shot and killed an assistant principal then badly wounded the principal and another assistant principal /. and david do we know what time of day this happened /?
shortly after two o'clock today it happened near the office of this school /.
in fact some witnesses at the office say it happened just right there next to them while they were t- there trying to conduct some business at the school /.
uh police are still trying to figure out what led up to that , why the student was there at the office and what exactly transpired between him and the administrators before those shots were fired /.
all right appreciate that /.
i know you uh just got to the scene /.
uh going to be c- it 's going to be a long night and a long couple of days as we 're trying to piece together uh the the information exactly what occured in those terrible moments before the shooting /.
here 's where the story and the backstory really start coming together /.
it 's very much an involving process as david just said /.
the young man has spoked to the police but no one is saying what he said /.
there 's a closed crime scene out there tonight evidence still to be gathered people statements /.
at some point the picture 's going to snap into focus tonight though we only have sketches /.
with us now from jacksboro tennesse ethan riggs who knows the suspect well and ethan 's cousin nathan lawson who was at the school today /.
uh guys i appreciate you being on the program tonight /.
you nathan y- you were at the school when it all unfolded /.
what did you see /?
well i 'm we could n't see anything because we were all in class /.
and i just heard that i just heard about the ma- the l- the uh the student going into the office or around the office and shooting the prinicpal and the assitant principals that were there /.
a- and what happened /?
uh you were in class /.
did did the bell ring did classes i mean how did they alert people what happenend /?
well we were already in class /.
and mr. steele got on the intercom and told everyone that we were having a lockdown /.
and how long did the lockdown last for /?
uh an hour and half two hours /.
uh ethan how long have you known the alleged shooter /?
i should just point out to to our viewers we 're not using the young man 's name /.
uh he 's underage /.
it 's policy and impolicy not to do that /.
um h- how long have you known him /?
well i knew him for a while back in elemetary school but much uh from here for a while back /.
but back in elementary school he was an all - right person and hardly ever got into any trouble /.
uh were were you surprised to hear that he might be involved in a shooting /?
yeah i was /.
nathan how about you /?
did y- did you ever think your classmate was capable of killing /?
no not really becau- /-
uh he 's been in some trouble before but nothing like this /. i would never think that he would do anything like this /.
do you know what what kind of trouble he had been in before /?
well in middle school he got suspended for a year for stabbing mr. steele with a pencil /.
he he stabbed somebody with a pencil /?
yeah the principal /.
the principal okay /.
uh n- now nathan or ethan y- i- d- uh teena- i mean you know you hear these reports /.
teen shooters they 're often descibed as you know kids who have been picked on or bullied by peers /.
uh w- was he that type /?
was he a loner /?
do you know did he get picked on /?
well in elementary school he was never picked on /.
like i said he had he had friends just like anybody else /.
would n't say he was popular or anything /.
but everybody got along with him /.
well it 's got to be a a a just a bizarre day for you for both of you and a and a tragic day for your school /.
and i appreciate both of you being with us to talk about what you know /.
thanks very much /.
i want to talk a little bit more now on why not why in this case because frankly we do n't know that and we do n't want to speculate , that 's unknowable wh- but why in so many other cases because even though it is too soon to tell whether this one fits a pattern there is a pattern and we have seen it time and time again /.
bitter experience has taught us that /.
(advp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (rb here 's cnn 's heidi collins /.
columbine springfield pearl red lake minnesota this past march and now jacksboro tennessee /.
it is a list that conjures up images of screaming children injured victims and gun - wielding kids /.
different towns with tragically similar stories /.
what makes these young men snap /. and what qualities if any do school shooters share /?
according to the fbi there are dozens of risk factors when it comes to school violence /.
but there is no one definitive profile of this type of criminal /.
most often the perpetrator is a white male age eleven to eighteen who was described as feeling picked on or bullied by his peers /.
we allow boys to be angry and aggressive /.
but we do n't allow them to express fear and sadness and other more vulnerable emotions /.
so hence when they when they get rejected or they get disappointed they have a harder time dealing with that /.
and it often comes out in anger /.
most of the shooters like you see in this video of dylan clebold and eric harris from columbine high school had a fascination with firearms or violent video games /.
/.
and while there were signs or warnings about their intentions they were not taken seriously at the time /.
the sheriff 's department did n't respond to our um reported threats by eric harris against our son for thirteen months /.
columbine would not have happened if they had investigated that to begin with /.
classmates say clebold and harris who brought terror to littleton colorado in nineteen ninety - eight and jeff weiss the red lake minnesota teen who killed nine people and wounded seven before fatally shooting himself all wore dark trenchcoats and were fans of marilyn manson /.
kip kinkel who killed two students in springfield oregon was a fan of manson 's music as well /.
according to the fbi all of the shooters may have felt the desire to defend narcissitic views of themselves and had very low self - esteem /.
luke woodham killed two students in pearl mississippi /.
well i guess you all start remembering me now /.
i 'm probably going to get pretty famous /.
famous for two things that seem to unite all of these young men no one believed they were capable of committing such horrible acts and no one was able to stop them /.
heidi collins cnn new york /.
we hear that over and over again /.
i i never expected they could do such a thing /.
still ahead tonight more late election returns more races that could affect you more questions about how this affects the president and his party /.
also ahead in rwanda a country a rocked by genocide ten years ago let 's see how it 's affecting the animals still to this day /.
around the country and the world this is three sixty /.
uh you know no matter where you stand politically it is tough to dispute the president 's good fortune /.
though battered in the polls this is an off - year for house and senate races /.
there are a number of races however being decided tonight /.
and as they count the votes across the country we 'll be giving you the latest on those races which may have national overtones as well /.
joining us now is cnn 's john king and jeff greenfield /.
uh let 's start with john king from dc with breaking news on the election results /.
john what 's the latest /?
well anderson the democrats are celebrating in the two biggest races tonight /.
those are the races for the governorships in virginia and new jersey /.
cnn projecting that tim kaine currently the lieutenant governor will be the next governor of the state of virginia /.
tim kaine a democrat winning in virginia a state president bush carried a year ago /.
and in new jersey another democratic victory /.
john corzine currently a member of the united states senate will be the next governor of new jersey according to cnn projections /.
one republican victory tonight /.
that is in new york city /.
mayor michael bloomberg the associated press projects will be re-elected as the mayor of new york city /.
a democrat turned republican /.
so that a frustrating race for the democrats /.
but democrats will celebrate those two state - wide victories virginia of course the most significant /.
president bush carried that state a year ago /.
he campaigned for the republican candidate just last night an election eve appearance /.
democrats will certainly make the case that the president 's troubles are continuing in the state of virginia /.
i will say though anderson i think the bigger national question out of the state of virginia might be that this helps the current incumbant governor mark warner /.
he is leaving office and thinking about running for president /.
his party 's strength there tonight will only encourage that /.
jeff any surprises to you /?
no uh the most startling thing which we do n't often talk about is the sheer amount of money that these people have /.
mike bloomberg is a five billion dollar man who threw seventy million dollars into this campaign /.
there were ads in cantonese and russian /.
he won a landslide /.
i 'll cross the river /.
john corzine 's worth about three hundred million defeated doug forrester a piker only worth about fifty million dollars though it was a combined campaign of about fifty million dollars /.
mark warner who john king just talked about has a personal wealth of two hundred million /.
and later tonight when we go to california the gentleman named schwartzeneggar who has about a hundred million dollars threw millions into his big successful effort at governor /.
but c- can the democrats really crow about about what 's going on in virginia and what 's going in new jersey /?
well they will /.
um and th- they won uh and in virginia particularly /.
virginia was one of the first southern states to to go republican /.
i think nixon carried it in nineteen sixty /.
it is significant when a democrat succeeds a democrat not just because it gives mark warner talking points but it is a crimson red state /.
do we want to make too much of it /?
no we do n't /.
john king uh arnold schwartzeneggar 's not on the ballot /.
but i- eh some of his critics say he really with some of these ballot initiatives /.
uh when do the polls close there /?
the polls close eleven o'clock eastern out in california /.
and to follow up on the point jeff just made about perhaps not overstating the impact for the president i think one of the things we will watch closely tonight is that some of the polls are showing that the american people are a bit testy shall we say um not patient anymore with all of the politicians /.
and that of course would affect the republicans more because they are in power in washington controlling the presidency and the congress /.
whether they take it out on governor schwartzeneggar in california could be another test of that as well /.
jeff /.
one quick point /.
the election that mattered for next year has already happened that special election in the ohio congressional district with cincinatti a republican district /.
former iraqi war combat veteran i guess he 's a he is a present veteran paul hackett came within four points of beating the republican in a district that no r- democrat has come close to carrying /.
that 's the one that 's giving the republicans willies for next year /.
all right jeff we 'll join you later /.
john king as well thanks very much /.
still ahead on three sixty a family torn apart on whether to let their son die /.
a case that may be heading where terri schiavo 's did /.
a fifteen year old boy at the center of it all /.
and in a corner of the world where genocide claimed nearly a million lives a new struggle between man and beast /.
around the world and across america this is three sixty /.
in a moment a life and death struggle over a fifteen year old boy who is in a coma uh who is lying breathing on a ventilator /.
the fight is between two parents who are divorced over what to do about their son /.
but first a check of the he- day 's headlines /.
(advp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (rb here 's cnn 's erica hill in atlanta /.
hey erica /.
hey anderson we begin tonight in jacksboro tennessee where police say a student opened fire on a principal and two assistant principals in an office in a high school /.
one of the assistant principals was killed , another critically /.
in iraq the foreign military occupation of that country is authorized at least through december of two thousand six /.
that 's because today the un security council voted to extend the mandate that allows some one hundred fifty - seven thousand us troops twenty - two thousand troops from other countries to operate there /.
the iraq provisional government requested the extension /.
in australia supporters of alleged terror suspect with tv reporters shouting stay away /.
australian authorities say they prevented a terrorist attack through their undercover work /.
seventeen people were arrested /.
officials said they moved in because the alleged plot had passed the planning stage /.
meantime a very different crowd reaction in salem oregon where two couples in - laws who invested forty dollars in lottery tickets had their claim certified today in the second biggest payout in us lottery history /.
three hundred forty million smackers /.
talk about a little bit uh of love to share around the family there /.
but anderson sounds like they 're going g- to lead a very normal life /.
they 're saying may not even get that many more presents under the tree this christmas /.
wow man i hope so /.
you know hear all these horror stories about how people react /.
and let 's just hope they sock it away and save it up for their kids or something /.
i know /.
erica thanks /.
we 'll check in with you a little bit later /.
you know it 's it 's hard to think of a more agonizing decision that a parent could face choosing whether to let a child die or to hold out hope no matter what the doctors and all the other experts say /.
usually these horrible decisions are made in private /.
sometimes unfortunately they divide an entire country /.
the sad case of terri schiavo not only tore her family apart /.
it really re-ignited a debate as thorny as it is heartbreaking /.
the case of jansen jones is just as complicated and equally heartbreaking /.
cnn 's rick sanchez from bountiful utah with more /.
rick /?
yeah thanks so much anderson /.
this is the new facility where uh jansen jones is going to be staying from now on /.
his father decided that he should be here /.
uh this is what we know about his case /.
he was probably unable to breathe accoding to his parents and experts who have talked to him for about twenty minutes /.
now we 've talked to medical experts about this situation /.
and they tell us if a fifteen year old goes without oxygen for fifteen to twenty minutes , what results is usually severe and irreparable brain damage /.
(advp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (rb here now is jansen 's story /.
you 're not supposed to have a heart attack when you 're only fifteen years old /.
i 'll never forget the morning that uh i got the news /.
the news was grim /.
margaret 's little boy with the likeable smile and the dimple cheeks had experienced full cardiac arrest /.
what 's worse it happened on this dark street corner one morning while riding his bike to school /.
he was all alone no mom no dad no help until finally he was spotted by a paramedic on her way to work /.
when we found him he was um still on his bike /.
um and his head was um against cement /.
jansen jones was rushed by helicopter to the hospital /.
did you think he would be able to pull through /?
i had faith /.
but then doctors showed margaret her son 's mri test and explained to her what results when the brain is deprived of oxygen /.
does he blink /?
no /.
does he make any sounds /?
no /.
nothing /.
nothing /.
are you convinced that he is in fact brain - dead /?
yes i am /.
margaret made a decision after talking to hospital officials here at the university of utah that she would take her son off of life support /.
she made the decision though not based solely on science or even her own observations /.
she tells us she made the decision based on her christianity her faith /.
and you do n't think that god would want you to have your son continue in the condition he 's in now /?
no /.
you 're convinced of that /.
yes /.
but god is also the reason margaret 's ex-husband jansen 's father gives for his decision to keep the boy on life support /.
he needs to be given a chance t- to live /.
also a devout christian john jones has little faith in what doctors tell him /.
doctors have been wrong before and misdiagnosed /.
i do n't agree with him at all /.
in fact when asked you think letting him go is the christian thing to do , she says /-
yes i think so /.
while he says /-
i believe in in a living god /.
and i believe that uh you can still perform miracles as you want to call them /.
two parents one god and one life or death decision that may end up being settled in a court of law /.
rick how could this wind up in the courts /?
well here in the state of utah because the father had custody of the child they 've been divorced now for uh three years he would be able to make the decision /.
however if the mother decides that she wants to take him to court to see if her decision is allowed all the folks in this uh state that i have talked to who 've dealt with matters like this in the past say that judges usually allow the evidence to be heard from both sides /.
that would mean anderson what you would have is another court battle as you alluded to earlier similar to the schiavo case /.
all right rick sanchez in bountiful /.
thanks very much rick /.
you know it 's been more than seven months now since terri schiavo 's life came to an end /.
she died march thirty - first thirteen days after her feeding tube was removed /.
up to that point we got to know schiavo 's parents and her husband fairly well as their fight played out all too publicly on television /.
since terri 's death they have n't been seen much on the national stage /.
but their battles go on /.
tonight in a new segment we 're calling memory lapse we take a look at what the family is doing right now /.
teri 's husband michael is back in the news making a splash in politics far from home by endorsing the candidacy of democrat tim kaine for governor of virginia in tonight 's election /.
michael schiavo spoke out against politicians intervening in family affairs /.
he 's also been busy writing about his side of the battle over his wife /.
he and author michael hirsch are colloborating on a book titled terri the truth /.
it 's scheduled to be released in march /.
and that will once again put him at odds with terri 's parents whose still untitled memoir will be released that same month /.
the schindlers ' book will share their struggle to keep terri alive a story they 've been through speeches and public statements /.
last week at a convention in omaha nebraska bob and mary schindler called terri 's death quote judicial homicide and hinted that euthanasia advocates may have been behind it /.
the schindlers also have been fighting the right to die movement through the terri schindler schiavo foundation /.
no doubt when those books come out we 'll be hearing about this case for quite some time to come /.
still to come on three sixty , it 's unlike anything you 've ever seen before /.
animal expert jack hannah takes us to a place where people and wildlife try to co-exist a place where both share a horrific past /.
and later a new look at your sex life a new survey is out the most extensive they say in fifty years /.
see how you may compare to some others out there /.
stay with us /.
a little bit more than a decade ago d- in the central african nation of rwanda something unspeakable happened /.
genocide though the us refused to call it that at first /.
eight hundred thousand people at least women men and children were brutally killed hacked to death stabbed thrown into rivers /.
today the genocide 's effects are still haunting both the survivors and the wildlife in rwanda /.
you see many of those who fled some of them settled in an animal refuge /.
renown wildlife advocate jack hannah director of the columbus zoo recently went to rwanda to see how the people and animals are co-existing /.
rwanda this breathtakingly beautiful land is soaked in blood the people living with the pain of their history /.
akagera national park once a spectacular wildlife refuge is now a refuge to many rwandans who survived the genocide and returned to their native land trying to start life anew /.
there are so many people in rwanda now they 've taken over two - thirds of the national park /.
and because of that rwanda now faces a problem /.
what will happen to the wildlife /?
how will the animals co-exist with humans /?
that 's what jack hannah the renown wildlife advocate wanted to find out as he went in search of wild elephants /.
there 's said to be eighty elephants in akagera /.
but for hannah and his crew finding even one was not unlike looking for that proverbial needle in a haystack /.
now the elephant 's back that way , right /?
hannah hired a boat to take him to a fishing village where there had been reports of a male elephant /.
they search for hours and hours /.
and finally /-
oh yeah i see it /.
but even a wildlife expert like hannah was surprised to find such a mighty creature submerged in lake water /.
it was very unusual behavior /.
look it at that /.
he 's like a submarine /.
he 's going to use his trunk /.
whoa look at that /.
look at him move tha- /-
he is going fast /.
that is fast /.
big elephant /.
an estimated eleven feet tall , weighing perhaps fourteen thousand pounds the mature bull elephant was as big and angry as any they'd 'd seen before /.
and he started to pursue them /.
that is fast /.
remember elephants can swim everybody /.
and they got a they got like a periscope /.
i do n't know if he 's walking or swimming /.
but he 's moving /.
hannah and his crew beat it to shore and to safety not realizing that in april the us embassy in kigali had issued a warning to american tourists about a rogue elephant charging visitors /.
your trunk go like this /.
on shore hannah was greeted by local kids /.
trunk /.
that 's it /.
that 's it /.
and in exchange for his kindness they shared a little known secret about the rogue elephant /.
turns out this monster of the deep was in fact an old friend of the children 's /.
and to prove it they lured him in with sweet words and sweet potatoes /.
thank you so much /.
thank you /.
thank you /.
that 's that 's something else /.
that 's all i can tell you /.
akagera national park may not be all that it once was /.
nor of course is rwanda /.
but jack hannah says that there is a sense of healing and as in the mighty steps of elephants there are small steps being made towards recovery /.
had you any h- ever seen behavior like that in elephants /?
no not in a while /.
uh when i saw the kids doing it i went up there /.
and i said i ca n't believe this big bull elephant a wild bull elephant /.
but the kids had you know /-
ali- animals know people /.
and h- he knew no harm in that village /.
and they actually were taking care of it /.
and of course when he went in the musk i guess he tipped over a jeep or two and you got to be careful when that happens /.
we 're going to take a quick break /.
and then we 'll be back with uh jack hannah /.
a lot more uh coming up tonight on three sixty /.
stay with us /.
before the break we went to africa with renown wildlife advocate jack hannah director of the columbus zoo /.
he took us to a region of rwanda where those who survived the genocide of eleven years ago or ten and a half years ago are living side by side with wildlife /.
we showed you the huge elephant he encountered /.
and that was n't all he saw /.
jack hannah joins me now once again to show us exclusive footage of the mountain gorillas he visited /.
uh we were just talking about rwanda /.
i 've been there a lot over the years uh and and have visited these gorillas /.
it 's the most incredible animal viewing i think on the planet /.
at least for me /.
yeah not just the viewing /.
it 's the experience anderson of of being there /.
it 's just people do n't realize they can all do it as well /.
uh this last year i- in tourism increased sixty - seven percent in rwanda /.
and the gorilla population under president kagame has increased seventeen percent /.
one of the only countries in africa where animals are really increasing as far as population /.
and you can go i mean you some of the footage that that we 're we 're showing now is is footage that you shot /.
and it 's just it 's incredible /.
you and anyone can go /.
a tourist can go and as long as they you know do it respectfully can go and sit with these gorilas just as you are /.
exactly right /.
right there /.
one hour /.
and of course y- you 're not allowed to approach them /.
they approach you /.
and that 's what you see here /.
these animals uh uh approach you /.
now this is a this is one actually that was uh uh taken out of th- uh out of the wild and brought to a to a to a veteranarian 's place right there below uh you know where the where the gorillas are /.
that 's a lowland gorilla is what you 're seeing there uh one that was brought /-
and of course we just ca n't put it back out in the wild yet /.
uh the mountain gorilla as you well you know are the ones with the much longer hair live up about eight thousand feet /.
it 's where you went to visit /.
yeah i i went there on vacation this summer /.
and it it 's just incredible /.
(advp-loc-tpc-1 (rb there they are right there /.
they 're climbing all around you /.
they literally brush by you at times /.
what are the similarities to humans /?
i mean everyone always says how how you know much like humans they appear /.
well well the similarities are it 's it 's a family structure /.
and y- and you watch the four and three and four years old play with the little uh eight to ten week old babies you know when their mother might let them go away just a little bit /.
right /.
an- and and you see the proctection /.
they 're not a a a king kong type of animal /.
and the neat thing about it is there will be a web camera up there /.
uh john dick has ha- got the tower up there so people can click on it within a year from now and watch the gorillas in the wild /.
no kidding really /?
be unbelieveable /.
that 's amazing /.
unbelieveable /.
wow i- eh the genocide i mean it it it permeates everything still in rwanda /.
i mean kagame has done a remarkable job with the country /.
um i- i- how did you i mean how has it impacted on the animals /?
well as as far as the animals uh president kagame uh a lot of the refugees came back in /.
some of them got into the parks /.
but now what he 's done , he 's protected those parks where no one absolutely nobody 's allowed to go inside the park boundaries now /.
uh the gorillas are coming back seventeen percent /.
tourism is up /.
as i said lake akagera national park is incredible /.
th- they even now have the habituation of chimpanzees /.
you can actually now i just was a- one of the first people to go there /.
and so you can go to one of the only countries in africa and see the chimpanzees in the wild as well as the gorillas /.
you also worked with a woman uh rosamond carr who runs an orphanage /.
and you have some video uh of of what she has done /.
oh gosh /.
she 's been there uh for for years and i- is a legend in that country /.
for about forty - five years /.
uh she 's a remarkable lady /.
yeah she really is /.
we 've given the columbus zoo and al- /-
with partners of conservation we 've raised almost one point four million dollars for the orphanage as well as the artisans women with the artisans that do the baskets and the beekeepers /.
so we 're tr- uh teaching people how to be p- have productive lives in rwanda /.
this is her right here /.
and these are the kids by the way in the old orphange /.
and now she 's moving them up to her home in the mountains about an hour out of kasenji as you well know on the border of the democratic republic of congo /.
and what we did , we brought all sorts of things for for the orphans there incredible incredible children /.
and these are kids whose parents w- were killed in the genocide /.
exactly /.
and and and by the way it 's all one rwanda right now as we were talking /.
no tutsis and hutus anymore /.
president kagame said it 's all one rwanda , we all are together now /.
i- it 's it 's interesting because you go there and people are offended if you ask are you hutu or are you tutsi /.
exactly /.
because th- i- th- eh they do n't want those divisions /.
no they do n't want those divisions /.
and yet they all li- h- live together /.
and you would think that they would have that division /.
but you sure do n't have it /.
you have a tremendous love there /.
and by the way it 's probably now the cleanest country i 've ever seen in africa /.
i i could not believe what i s- /-
and the road system is incredibile /.
they 're good /.
y- y- what 's amazing too is you go to see the gorillas and you start talking to the guides who are taking you up and you ask them did you lose anyone and they will just turn and without blinking an eye tell you you know my all my family is gone /.
yeah i- we had a guide do the same exact thing /.
and and i- we said how h- where 's your par- family /.
and he said w- y- we i lost my dad and then goes right along and talks to his buddy who might be a h- a hutu or a tutsi /.
and so /-
but they never ever mention that uh whatsoever /.
but i think it 's the greatest turnaround of any country in the world in the last eh ten years /.
and the gorillas are are coming back , are n't they /?
i mean they 're /- oh yeah seventeen percent increase /.
and of course rwanda has about three hundred and seventy , right /.
uganda has about another three hundred /.
so you 're talking about a species that is very very vital as far as their numbers are concerned /.
you know if somebody got a cold up there like the veterinary project 's doing a great job up there right now uh you would have a disaster up there /.
so that 's why they be very careful if people ca n't have colds if they go up and visit the gorillas that type of thing /.
uh jack it 's always good to see you /.
i 'm i 'm glad uh y- you spent so much time in rwanda /.
and i 'm glad you talk as fast as i do /.
oh yeah i do /.
i got a little cottage over there /.
so i 'm going to be spending a lot of time over there /.
well you 're doing great things for the country /.
appreciate it /.
thanks /.
thank you /.
thank you /.

let 's look at some of the other stories that are making headlines right now /.
at this moment a fatal school shooting in jackso- uh jacksboro tennessee leaves an assistant principal dead /.
no students were injured /.
authorities are holding a fifteen year old in the attack /.
the school 's principal and a second assistant principal are hospitalized with serious wounds /.
another cia leak probe may be in the works /.
this time the question is who told the washington post that the cia is operating prisons in eastern europe /.
republican congressional leaders have asked for an investigation /.
to baghdad now /.
another defense attorney in saddam hussein 's trial is murdered /.
a second co-defendant 's lawyer was gunned down /.
the killings are raising questions about whether the trial will resume as scheduled on november twenty - eighth /.
indiana now /.
the mobile home park residents who survived sunday 's deadly tornado will be allowed back to the area tomorrow /.
authorities put the official death count at 22 people in two indiana counties /.
back to jacksboro tennessee now where tonight campbell county comprehensive high school is a crime scene the site of today 's deadly school shooting /.
cnn 's david mattingly joins us with the latest on the investigation /.
david /?
anderson some new information for you at this hour /.
we 're hearing from knoxville the principal gary seal and assistant principal jim pierce are both out of surgery at this hour /.
both of them are now listed in serious condition /.
these are the two survivors of this shooting /.
a third assistant principal ken bruce was killed as a student a fifteen year old student opened fire with a handgun near the school offices /.
that happened a little after two o'clock today /.
and as you might be able to see behind me with all the flashing blue lights the investigation still underway /.
we have also learned that at this hour investigators have questioned others as to where this young man was able to get a gun and how he was able to get it into the school questioning others to find out if others might have been somehow connected to this case /.
but at this point most of the investigation is going on inside the building collecting every possible piece of evidence that they can /.
the suspect is in custody at a juvenile detention facility /.
he was taken there after being treated for what looked like a gunshot wound to his hand /.
investigators are being very careful about how they say uh this all came about /.
uh they 're not willing at this point to put any sort of a b and c sequence together /.
uh there are some people who knew this young man who say that he was troubled /.
but authorities will not confirm what was going through his mind or what was happening as this shooting occurred /.
anderson /?
david we 've spoke uh i- in the last hour to a young man who knows uh this young man who 's now in custody who said that he had been suspended previously for a year for stabbing an assitant principal wi- with a pen or a pencil /.
do you know anything more about that /?
uh authorities will not talk about that tonight /.
uh we 're hoping that they will shed more light on that tomorrow /.
but we are hearing that story from multiple students /.
we 're not sure if it 's all part of the rumors that go around after these type of incidents do occur /.
but there seems to be some certain credibility in the widespread belief that this uh this student did have problems the year prior and had problems uh as he came back to this high school /.
and david we 're looking at pictures now of of the suspect being put into a police car /.
i i do n't know if you 've seen the pictures /.
is that blood on his shirt /?
that is blood on his shirt /.
again he was treated for what looked like a gunshot wound to his hand suggesting that he might have been wounded himself during whatever struggle that occurred after these shootings /.
authorities tell us that he had been subdued by the time the first responders arrived here so that he was subdued by staff here at the school /.
after all that happened the school was in lockdown /.
the students were locked in their classes for about two hours /.
they were released uh to some very anxious parents here outside the school grounds /.
the school is going to be closed for the rest of the week anderson /.
there will be counseling here going on for anyone who needs it /.
and that goes for not just the students but the staff here as well /.
all right david thanks good reporting /.
as david it is an active investigation and crime scene as you can see very much uh still an active crime scene /.
uh if we had to pick a single thing to underscore how completely life has changed in this country since nine eleven it might be the fact that there are now arguments serious ones not only against but also for torture /.
never was a debate about this subject before /.
now there certainly is /.
cnn 's tom forman has been investigating /.
if you could save the life of a soldier rescue the hostage children stop the next terrorist bomb by torturing a prisoner for information would you do it /?
i 'd stick a knife in somebody 's thigh in a heartbeat /.
retired general spider marks a cnn consultant worked for us army intelligence teaching interrogation techniques /.
the kind of enemies we 're fighting have no sense of right or wrong /.
they will go to any depths to achieve their ends /.
do we have to go with them /?
we need to w- we do n't need to go with them /.
we need to preclude them from going there /.
and that might include some use of torture in order to prevent it /.
polls have shown that more than sixty percent of americans think it can sometimes be justified /.
but 's the catch /.
experts including general marks are convinced with the vast majority of prisoners it just does n't work /.
it does not give you credible accurate timely inactionable intelligence /.
mark jacobson a former defense department official outlines the troubles /.
you need to know a prisoner has critical information /.
the prisoner must be succeptable to torture /.
and oh by the way when people are tortured , when people endure physical pain they 're going to seek to stop that as quickly as possible /.
if i torture you you 're going to tell me exactly what i expect to hear /.
the white house under fire over reports of secret cia prisons overseas says torture is not allowed /.
but /-
we are going to do what is necessary to protect the american people /.
we are also going to do so in a way that adheres to our laws and to our values /.
uh we have made that very clear /.
the definition of torture is infliction of severe physical pain as a means of punishment or coersion /.
legal authorities around the world are arguing over what that means /.
some insist the abuses at that iraqi prison easily qualify along with sleep deprivation humiliation extreme fear /.
others say those things do n't even come close /.
the global jury is still out /.
and even experts are pondering a paradox /.
so in your experience and in your view torture as a policy should be against the law /.
true /.
and yet we might still have to use it /.
true /.
and wondering which truth about torture will stand in a dangerous world /.
tom forman cnn washington /.
well it 's interesting president bush has said categorically we do n't torture /.
he also says we 'll do whatever is necessary /.
so what exactly does that mean /?
we asked a couple law professors earlier this evening to discuss the issue with us /.
john yoo of university of california berkeley who served in the justice department from two thousand and one to two thousand and three /.
he 's also a visiting scholar at the american enterprise institute /.
also joining us alan dershowitz professor of law at harvard the author of a great many books including the case for peace how the arab israeli conflict can be resolved /.
also involved in discussion was bill goodman at the center for contitutional rights /.
(advp-loc-prd-tpc-1 (rb here 's some of the conversation /.
professor dershowitz under what circumstances do you think torture is justified /?
torture is never justified /.
and i hope we never have to use it in the united states /.
but if we ever had a ticking bomb terrorist who could under torture reveal the location of a bomb that would destroy hundreds of thousands of people i guarantee you we would use it /.
that 's an empirical judgement not a normative one /.
and if we would use it then we have to use it only with accountability /.
and that means that the president of the united states or the vice president or the secretary of defense or the chief justice has to specifically authorize precisely the kind of extreme measures that are permitted to be used /.
no extreme measures without accountability that has to be the rule /.
bill goodman you believe that 's uh a slippery slope /.
i think it 's a very slippery slope /.
i once i think once you start to say well under these circumstances empirically you 're going to and you have to provide these kinds of measures if you do it then you 're basically that i- under certain circumstances it can happen it should happen and then it 's going happen under more than those exceptional circumstances /.
it 's going to start becoming the regular rather than the unusual /.
professor yoo y- let me bring y- you in here um /.
what do you think about professor dershowitz 's argument tha- that torture in under any circumstances is wrong uh a- and that th- he supports the mccain amendment uh but if the preside- at the president 's direction uh under extraordinary circumstances /.
i agree with much of what alan says /.
i do think torture is wrong /.
it 's illegal /.
what the mccain amendment is just repeating is the geneva convention standard that already applies in iraq /.
what it does n't what the problem with the mccain amendment is , that it prevents the cia to use interrogation methods wi- would not be torture but would fall under this vaguer term cruel inhumane degrading treatment which is /.
but what is your definition of torture /?
i mean i y- uh i understand you were one of the lawyers in the justice department early on who helped craft documents outlining you know what some called a before nine eleven approach and after nine eleven approach /.
and the definition of torture uh that i understand from what i 've read that that you were advocating was was a very narrow one /.
i think look /.
we can all have an argument where exactly that line is /.
and i think it means severe pain and suffering either physical or mental can not be imposed /.
that would be torture /.
see /. i would have a broader definition of torture /.
i would p- m- define it very broadly then prohibit it /.
but then if it 's felt necessary to use any of these measures short of torture water boarding extreme psychological measures if the president of the united states is prepared to put his credibility on the line and say the future of the nation is stake we must violate the law in this instance like we would if we had to shoot down a civilian airliner let the president take accountability /.
and that would broaden the definition of torture /.
it would n't have any of these escape valves that we now have and would place accountability squarely where it belongs not on the shoulders of sergeant england or some other low ranking official /.
you 're you 're you 're right now you 're just being an apologist for torture /.
oh come on /.
stop the f- stop throwing around words like that /.
y- uh let me let me let me let me please finish /.
i mean that 's just insulting to the intelligence of the audience /.
look /.
let me finish /.
you know that /?
let me talk /.
and then you can answer /.
yeah /.
okay /?
you know n- you know better than that /.
j- just what 's your point /?
my point is this that w- torture is new in the in the american discourse in many ways /.
we have not seen the prevalence , we have not seen an outcropping of torture notwithstanding all of the wars in which we 've engaged until this current administration /.
totally false /.
totally false /.
it was rampant in the second world war /.
rampant /.
always /.
there always has but not in the degree not in the level not in the amount that we have seen /.
much worse /.
much worse /.
and the fact is that by saying that we are going to allow certain circumstances under which we will apologize for torture /-
much worse in the vietnam war /.
much worse in the korean war /.
much worse /.
i ca n't i ca n't talk without me /.
all right a- r- you 're saying it 's been much worse /.
much worse /.
professor professor yoo eh b- president bush says the us does not torture /.
do you believe that 's true /?
yeah i believe it 's not true , that if there is abuses like abu ghraib occuring they 're just illegal and ought to be punished /.
professor dershowitz does the us torture /?
of course it does /.
and it does with a wink and a nod from the president of the united states from the secretary of defense from the vice president /.
just the message he gave yesterday we do n't approve torture but we approve doing whatever is necessary to stop terrorism /.
and that sends a mixed message /.
bill let me uh r- uh r- tell you something that senator roberts has said about the mccain amendment /.
he says that the b- uh basic and i 'm paraphrasing that basically the the element of surprise what the enemy does not know about what we 're going to do to them is a very powerful tool /.
and so you do n't want to specify /.
you do n't want to write out e- exactly what can and can not be done /.
that is truly apologism for for torture /.
that 's saying that torture does work can work /.
and it 's never been proven to work /.
bill goodman professor yoo professor dershowitz thanks very much /.
thank you /.
still ahead on three sixty . it may be off - year elections but they 're being closely watched /.
the latest results and what they say about the future /.
also the crisis unfolding in france what the riots and the raids behind them have revealed . and why maureen dowd thinks women of her generation were sold a bill of goods /.
all the things we did that thought that we thought would make us more fascinating like high - powered careers /.
and we wanted that snappy hepburn tracy dialogue because actually a lot of guys find that draining /.
we 'll talk to her about that and a whole lot more /.
be right back /.
election returns are coming in from around the country /.
there are uh state and local races with nationally known faces and issues as well as a celebrity or two /.
with us tonight cnn 's john king and jeff greenfield /.
let 's start with breaking news and john king in dc /.
what 's the latest john /?
anderson more statements from the democrats celebrating tonight more events planned by the democrats tomorrow /.
they believe they have the upper hand in these off - year elections /.
the two biggest races the races for the governorships of virginia and new jersey /.
democrats winning in both of those states we can show you here /.
cnn projecting that tim kaine now the lieutenant governor will be the next governor of virginia winning quite handily fifty - two to forty - six percent over republican jerry kilgore /.
also in the state of new jersey john corzine the democrat with fifty - four percent of the vote right now beating doug forrester the republican just forty - three percent /.
ninety - one percent of the vote counted in new jersey /.
ninety - nine percent of the vote counted now in virginia /.
two democratic victories in the races for governor /.
republican michael bloomberg will win re-election in new york /.
republicans will celebrate that /.
that a source of frustration to democrats /.
how much does this mean nationally /?
that race in new jeresey was much more personally nasty about property taxes perhaps than about president bush or any national issues /.
the virginia race about the death penalty about other state issues as well traffic number one among them /.
but the democrats will certainly that the virginia race is proof that the republican base is demoralized /.
that will be studied anderson as we look at these off - year elections and how much they play into next year /.
many state ballot questions that are of some national import tonight /.
a anti-gas tax initiative in washington state /.
we wo n't get the results there until tomorrow /.
a split verdict if you will on the issue of gay rights /.
texas voters adopting a constituional amendment to finding marriage as between a man and woman /.
but supporters of gay rights winning a referendum in the state of maine /.
that is something to watch heading into next year as well because republicans think that helps increase turnout among conservatives /.
and ballots of course /.
uh the polls are still open in california /.
so we do n't know about the ballot initiatives there /.
is arnold schwarzenegger 's reputation on these ballots /?
yes they did /.
and they were not the first company that approached me /.
but i am not selling medicine or pharmaceuticals /.
i 'm sort of about selling a full body approach to wellness /.
um there 's a big gap between those that are mentally ill and the general population /.
something like eight to twenty years less life expectancy with mental illness /.
really /?
people are not able to care for themselves /.
they do n't make regular checkups with their doctor /.
they medicate with alcohol and too much food /.
and because of those lifestyle choices you know they 're dying sooner /.
so i really wanted to get out and address that and offer some common sense approaches /.
do you use medication too /?
i do use medication /.
do you name the drug you take /?
alright let 's go back linda /.
i do not name the drug /.
i do n't really feel that that 's responsible to name any drug /.
when did linda hamilton first when was that first day problem /?
well looking back i feel that a lot of my life there was a problem /.
(pp-tmp-tpc-1 (in as a teenager you mean /?
as a teenager even as a younger girl i had some depression /.
but no one really noticed it was depression /.
nor did i know in those days that that 's what it was /.
but i did feel different from other people /.
um i was in hiding a lot of my childhood although i had a wonderful upbringing and a very normal middle class upbringing /.
where 'd you grow up /?
in maryland on the chesapeake bay /.
salisbury maryland /.
what 'd your father do /?
my father was a doctor /.
oh /.
who died when i was five /.
oh /.
but he was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder /.
in those days they called it manic depression /.
but he had extreme mood swings and died in a car crash when i was five /.
and so it 's hard to separate you know what was the reality for me /.
was it loss of father that drove me into depression /?
and you know we can all look around and find situations that fuel a certain feeling in our lives /.
but i realize now looking back over my life that i was really just in hiding um comforted myself with food , i was a compulsive eater /.
overweight /?
by the time i was in high school i was a hundred and seventy pounds /.
and i was just very alone in life /.
did you get uh moody a lot /?
i was moody /.
but i think it was only when i got out of my childhood home and started having the freedom to be the wild girl and express all that was inside of me that i really got into trouble /.
were you a wild girl /?
i was a wild girl /.
i was a real alcoholic for the longest time /.
i messed with drugs /.
i mean i 've come through a lot of things /.
did you go to college /?
i was a chaotic mess even at the age of twenty two /.
i think that was probably the lowest of the low for me when i was twenty two years old and went into a therapist 's chair with such a broken heart such a broken life you know and a friend that had recently died just sort of pushed me over the edge /.
and you know it 's the best thing i ever did /.
i sought help for twenty years /.
i worked tirelessly to conquer my behaviors /.
you were in therapy for twenty years /?
for twenty years different therapies different body work acupuncture /.
i 've worked with psychiatrists therapists healers /.
no i mean i am a seeker /.
so i worked really hard to kind of curtail those behaviors /.
but i could not be in charge or in control of my behavior until i went on medicine when i got the proper diagnosis /.
and then i was able for the first time in my life to step back /.
did you go to college /?
i went to college for two years /.
what school /?
ah i went to washington college in chestertown maryland /.
did you have problems there /?
um i was an outsider even then /.
i lived off campus /.
never really felt like i belonged in the college drama department /.
i was always sort of separate /.
um and then when i realized that my real passion was for acting i took the rest of my money and my college fund and moved to new york and studied and maintained rather well in new york /.
when i got to los angeles at the age of twenty two all hell broke loose /.
even though you got acclaim and did well /.
so how do you explain /?
that 's a dichotomy /.
i mean some of us are luckier than others /.
what was your break /?
even though i say you know that i was under the you know terrible burden of mental illness i think there was a real survivor streak in me and a real fighter and a real fierceness /.
and maybe that 's what people saw and hired me for you know cause i was really just going to keep pushing until i got free of all of the things that were bothering me /.
what was your first break in la /?
my first break was a movie for television that i did with mickey roarke /.
mickey roarke was just breaking big at the time /.
and i replaced an actress actually who was just in over her head /.
mickey i think was an intimidating presence /.
and they had hired a girl who had done very little had done a lot of stage work but just was n't prepared to come to work and face mickey roarke /.
he played uh remember the greta rideout and john rideout story the first woman who sued her husband for rape /?
i played her in a film with mickey /.
when you hit it big with terminator and everything was going fantastic for you you were still bipolar , right /?
well very much /.
and somehow the bigger the life the bigger the illness /.
it just kept growing the illness my behavior /.
so you 'd get into a certain pattern of behavior /.
and now you 're dealing with a pattern of behavior as well as an emotional illness /.
so this did n't help it /?
no no i think it gave me a wonderful arena in which to act out all my rage /.
i 'd be like you 're really good at being mad /.
but uh for success it 's all about how you feel about yourself inside /.
and inside i was just a scared and out of control hurt little girl for most of my life /.
did marriages help /?
no um /.
you had two /?
as a matter of fact i would say /-
yes two marriages one to james cameron and before that to bruce abbot /.
i have a child with each /.
i would like to take this moment to say that i was n't married to peter horton which is sort of all over the websites that i 've been married three times so i look like /-
but that 's false information /.
i was never married to peter horton /.
um how old are the children /?
my son is sixteen /.
and my daughter is twelve /.
and how are they doing /?
they 're doing well /.
any signs of bipolar in them /?
no /.
but boy they have someone that 's watching them all the time for any signs /.
we have a household where we talk about our feelings and make sure that no one is afraid to speak of what 's going on /.
i just find it strange that in this world everyone is so easy to talk about the superficial you know and how people look and what they do to their faces but no one is really having the dialog of what 's going on inside of them /.
and i think that i hid my symptoms pretty well for most of my life /.
but there 's still a raging war going on /.
we 'll ask linda when it got its worst , how bad it got , what were some of the concepts she had to go through /.
we 'll be taking your calls at the bottom of the hour /.
tomorrow night rod stewart /.
we 'll repeat the roseanne barr interview sunday night and monday night /.
this is an eclectic show /.
colin powell robert downey jr. and sharon stone /.
way to make a living /.
we 'll be right back /.
we 're back with linda hamilton /.
were you comfortable because of the illness being frantic /?
actually i think that was a pretty ordinary place for me to go to /.
so it was n't hard for you to go nuts , right /?
i was frantic inside /.
no /.
and to just sort of let it get out there in a way that was you know safe /.
at its height how bad was it /?
what would you hallucinate /?
um it was not terrible hallucinations /.
the biggest low for me at its height the biggest low was uh the birth of my second child and a post-partem depression that followed which was very much like a psychosis /.
i could n't leave the house without thinking that they were going to be chopped into bloody pieces /.
i mean i had visions /.
i could n't leave my house without feeling /-
you know at this point i had gone through thirteen nannies or something /.
and i just did not feel that my kids were going to be ok if i was not in the house protecting them /.
did you ever think you would harm them /?
that happens sometimes /.
um no i have not ever felt that /.
but i know people that have /.
and i praise god that that did n't happen to me /.
did you have hallucinations too /?
not hallucinations as you would call them but cyclical thoughts that repeated terrible sleep disturbances /.
months would go by where i would n't get a decent night 's sleep , where it would literally feel like i could n't sleep /.
i had anxiety attacks /.
how did your husbands deal with this /?
well um i was a challenge /.
i think jim said to me once i like who i leave in the morning but i do n't always know who i 'm going to come home to at night because depending on what had happened during the day if something had distressed me , a small thing had become a huge thing and i could n't let it go and i could n't forgive and i could n't get out of myself and i just could n't let go /.
he directed you , did he not /?
yes he did /.
was that hard or easy /?
well we were he directed me long before we fell in love and had a relationship /.
and it was actually a long time before because it was 1984 when we first met and did the first terminator /.
so i had known him almost more than ten - fifteen years before we got married /.
could you work while depressed like mike wallace /?
yes i could work /.
yes i think there was an element of real survivor in me that was very highly functioning during most of this /.
and even with the alcohol abuse i think most people in my life did not notice that i was putting away enormous amounts of alcohol /.
did n't notice it /?
did n't notice it /.
um it 's amazing how tricky we can be /.
um or a lot of people must think that they 're getting away with something /.
but everyone really does notice /.
but i tell you /.
there was no one in my life at that point saying hey you need help /.
suicidal thoughts /?
um more about not wanting to be alive , not knowing how to thrive , not knowing what hope was /.
it was a very bleak existence /.
but i never would have taken the action to kill myself um just because what it would have cause i 'm a real nice girl and a pleaser and i could n't have done that to my family /.
someone said once when you 're really depressed good news and bad news are the same news /.
you could inherit five million dollars or lose five million dollars /.
it do n't change how you feel /.
true /?
true true /.
and no amount of counseling and therapy and taking my past apart helped /.
i would understand that i had lost my father , therefore i was creating one relationship after another of abandonment /.
and you know that for years going into it and still ca n't control the behavior /.
it was very frustrating /.
at a certain point i was just completely handicapped /.
i did not know /.
i said give me a behaviorist then /.
i 've got to change these behaviors /.
the rage /.
yeah what happened when you had a rage /?
i would throw jim 's stuff out of the house /.
so it would be waiting for him when he came home at night /.
this could be over a small thing /?
yes /.
um and i just would n't give in /.
if he would n't apologize i could n't go to any other place except i wish this had n't happened /.
and that 's no way to live a life /.
what was your love life like /?
well my two husbands were the sum of my love life /.
um and both of them were incredibly loving /.
my first husband i think was just especially unprepared for someone who had such extreme mood swings you know so much joy and the other side of that was so much sadness /.
and does it go away in a minute /?
it must be exhausting for anybody around to not know who you 're going to be next /.
in a minute we 'll ask linda what happened to bring it to a head , how she turned a corner /.
linda hamilton /.
want more information /.
you can go to www dot complete wellness approach dot com /.
we 'll ask how that works too /.
do n't go away /.
have a twin sister /?
i do have a twin sister /.
is she bipolar /?
i ca n't talk about that /.
it 's her mental illness or not /.
is she still acting /?
she 's not an actor /.
she 's a nurse /.
oh really /.
she doubled me in a little bit of a couple moments there /.
yes she did me a favor /.
got a sense of what it 's like /.
are you close /?
she 's a dear heart /.
yes we are very /.
what was the turning point of you /?
did you get so low that /-
what happened that you got wellness /?
i lost two marriages /.
um and i had been misdiagnosed or sort of half diagnosed with depression years before /.
um i do n't even know that there was a real antidepressant in those days /.
nobody mentioned that as a possible for me /.
but i finally did go on medication for the depression /.
and then of course like it 's just an interesting phenomena that people that have mental illness will not stay on their medication /.
they start to feel a little relief /.
and then they /-
we 're not programmed to take pills if we start to feel good /.
we feel good /.
and all the sudden we do n't feel that we need the medication anymore /.
and that happens at least two times out of three with people on medicine /.
i first took myself off thinking that i was through the critical period /.
and then i went through a total tale spin chemically and really just could not get up off the couch /.
i had two young children /.
and i did not know how to get up at night to put them to bed /.
so who did you turn to /?
so i um my family doctor was a tremendous help /.
he had given me some medicine to have in my drawer if i ever decided i wanted to go that route /.
i decided not to go that route but to work with exercise and nutrition /.
and i was largely successful for a year and a half /.
but it was six hours of exercise a day /.
i mean it was so much /.
compulsive /.
yes another compulsion because those endorphins made me feel better /.
well let me see what i can do /.
i was so resistant and i think like a lot of us afraid that the best part of me is going to be dimmed and dulled and suddenly i would n't know how to act anymore /.
but you know when you really are a candidate for the medicine and need it there are n't any real side effects /.
you need it /.
and um /-
so what made you go back on regular /?
well when i realized that it was costing me too much to just keep myself in a normal place every day /.
what other people call normal i would have to climb there every single day /.
any difference between depression and bipolar /?
is there any depression /?
i mean are they the same /?
i mean any different /?
no they 're not the same at all /.
uh bipolar disorder is characterized by mood swings severe mood swings /.
and it can um go through cycles where you are in the manic stage then in the depressed stage for months on end /.
it 's a high , right /?
could be manic /.
but when you 're manic you know you 're almost hearing voices /.
it 's incredible /.
and um it 's often misdiagnosed because nobody goes to their doctor and says hey i feel incredible , i can solve all of the world 's problems /.
give me five minutes and a team /.
and we 're th- you know /.
but the drugs have been amazing like lithium and others have been amazing /.
balance /.
alright what 's the what 's the complete wellness approach /?
it 's an incredible feeling /.
but nobody goes complaining to their doctor about that /.
true /.
to just create that equalizer and balance is something i never knew about /. /.
the complete wellness approach is a campaign that was started by eli lily and company um in conjunction with the university of medicine and dentistry in new jersey /.
ah a team of health care professionals led by a wonderful woman named betty breeland has developed a treatment /.
um they teach teams going around teaching teams to treat people with mental illnesses with the whole body /.
there 's a big gap that needs to be bridged /.
people are treated from here up or here down /.

we 'll go to calls for linda /.
scottsdale arizona hello /.
first of all linda you look phenomenal /.
hey thank you /.
and i 'd like to get ms. hamilton 's take on tom cruise 's statement of zero medications towards uh any mental or physical illness /.
thank you larry /.
k /.
i think that it would be arrogant to say that there 's that something is bad for everyone /.
um i think that it would be very irresponsible to deprive a lot of people of the hopefulness of a treatment um any more than i could say that my medication works well for everyone /.
you know it is a very individualized thing mental health /.
and i think that the words that should be banned from this english language are you should do this or you should never do that /.
you know i think we need to remain flexible and allow you know people to deal with their own mental conditions with their doctors and it 's none of our business /.
right true true /.
well i am very careful with rigid um you know toe the line /-
i tend to go the other way and say that (sbar-nom-tpc-5 (whnp-2 (whnp (wp whatever you can find that works for you you should embrace and hold on to and just make it work /.
boulder colorado hello /.
hello hi first i want to say i really respect your coming forward to help others about this and i think that 's a wonderful admirable thing /.
i 'm wondering what advice you have for spouses of someone with a mental illness particularly someone who is n't currently diagnosed , how to avoid misdiagnosis , just what can i do to help my husband and make sure that he does n't go through what you went through and and uh any advice /.
well i think it must be a very scary situation to be with someone you know needs help /.
i can tell you that the things that helped me most were the friends that looked at me and said we love you and we know that you can not help who you are being right now the way that you 're acting , that you can not control your behavior /.
but they um you know embraced me and let me know that the- they were beside me and behind me and that possibly i should just look a little further for some answers instead of jumping all over me and condemning me for my bad behavior /.
um you know i did have a group of loving and supportive friends who said we 're going to see you through this and you need some help and let 's keep looking /.
it 's hard though to be close to someone who is screaming at you /.
absolutely /.
or who is not talking or who is in a depressed state and locking the door to the bathroom and staying in there for fourteen hours /.
ah /.
i mean i have to tell you that when i married my first husband bruce i i went into hiding for the first year /.
i just started reading books /.
i mean the man married me /.
and i went into hiding for a year /.
i still do n't know what that was about /.
but imagine being a newlywed and having a wife that just disappears in the bedroom reading science fiction fantasy novels for a year /.
you know um you ca n't really explain what a depression is or where it comes from to someone that does n't understand /.
but if you could offer him um the freedom and the kindness to go and talk to somebody and seek the help and keep seeking the help that will help him a lot /.
redwing minnesota hello /.
hi ah hi larry hi linda /.
hi /.
hi /.
and i just wanted to say you are such an encouragement /.
i am currently trying to find out the mood swings and the anger and the shoving people away /.
but you are such an encouragement /.
and i am so very glad you are out there in our face so to speak and letting us know that people will support us /.
and i 've got such a fantastic fantastic husband /.
he 's my hero /.
what 's your question /?
oh i 'm glad for you /.
i just um wanted to to say how long approximately it took to to find something /.
did you have to try several medications /?
you know that 's it 's a little scary /.
but i 'm very encouraged by you /.
well yes /.
um i wish you the best /.
i just want you to know that i have such a compassionate heart for people that are going through this /.
and i think it 's important to know that you 're not alone , that there are millions of us and that we 're all sharing the burden with you right now /.
um i was lucky in that the first medication that i found worked for me /.
it was a huge fear of mine that it would n't work and that i 'd have to be a pin cushion and try this one /.
i mean the first time i talked to a pharmacologist and he tried to put me on this and said well if it does n't work , we 'll take this off and then we 'll put you on this i was like no thank you and left you know because i was so afraid that that would happen /.
but you 'll be on it you 'll be on it you 'll be on it the rest of your life /?
but um i 'm i 'm getting better every year /.
i mean i 'm still getting better /.
you know i 've been on medication now for eight years /.
and every year is just richer and richer because i 'm really returning to who who i was meant to be , who my parents raised /.
yes /.
you accept that /?
in the bipolar phase when the swing is high you must feel terrific /.
i accept that and um renounce it /.
totally terrific /.
and it could swing low in an hour /?
it can you know /.
it 's like um i used to say it would be like walking down a street and falling into a manhole cover an you know an un- uncovered manhole and then you know just like disappearing /.
all of the sudden i would disappear /.
and then i could n't find my way back up /.
the smallest thing /.
back with more calls for linda hamilton /.
do n't go away /.
that was from a nineteen eighty - two film her first film acting with her first husband bruce abbot /.
that was titled tag the assassination game /.
i never heard of this movie /.
neither did anybody else /.
what was it whoever tagged who first /?
oh ah right /.
tag you 're it /.
yes it was actually based on a college game that was really um wildly famous at the time yeah /.
how old were you there /?
dart gun /.
you 're like a little child look younger /.
kallabassas california hello /.
how old was i /?
neither did anybody else /.
hi um i thank you larry so much um for having linda on your show /.
um i 'm a therapist in kallabassas specializing in mood disorders /.
and linda i just want to tell you that um there is nothing better that you can do for individuals that are struggling um with the diagnosis /.
there is um a lot of shame /.
and when individuals like you take the time to do what you 're doing and um being so authentic and open it just desti- destigmatizes it /.
not only that but the information that you 're giving /.
i 'm learning from listening to you /.
um i 'm uh incredibly touched by what you have to say /.
and um you were talking about your children and how it is at home /.
and i just wondered if you had any more suggestions for parents who may have children that /-
you know sometimes they 're misdiagnosed with add /.
and i do n't want to get off the topic /.
but just anything that you could say to parents that might be struggling with children going through this process /.
well i think the best uh that that anybody can do and i sort of offer this to anyone is to just start the dialog with your children um talk to them about their moods and how they really feel /.
you know you have to watch the behaviors too and see if they 're you know seem to be keeping something back /.
but just start the dialog /.
i remind my children i guess because i grew up depressed you know i remind my children every day that there is absolutely nothing that ca n't be talked about and solved with the right team of people but they have to be willing to speak because i think the secret keeping and all of that shame compounds over the years and then you have such a huge amount to get through with someone /.
so we just encourage open dialog in our family so that we can um attack everything together and they feel supported no matter what comes up /.
do you feel since the gene is there do you watch your children /.
and do you get a little worried at the first thing that looks wrong /?
that 's normal /.
uh yes i do /.
yes i do /.
it is normal /.
tacoma washington hello /.
yeah you 're on /.
yeah you 're on /.
yes linda um um i i do n't know if your- i 'm on or not /.
ok /.
uh my i first of all i 'd like to thank you for stressing the fact that when you feel good you do n't take your medications /.
and uh i found that to be true /.
i had training in mental health and also worked in drugs and alcohol in a women 's prison and found that there are so many women in prison who have that same problem and in terms of bipolar and were self medicating and they 're in prison for a great amount of time and when they are released then they go off the medication if they are on it /.
and i- it 's just so important for you to bring up these subjects /.
and it is so sad to see so many women /.
my question is is there any work being done to help those women who are in prison /?
um you know i 'm not qualified to answer that /.
i would hope so /.
um i 'll look into it /.
i know you will /.
you use /-
but um you know there is just a a huge general population out there that needs help /.
and although i 'm not encouraging people to take medicine , if they are on a medicine that works for them rule number one is to stay on that medicine /.
you used alcohol /.
did you ever use other drugs /?
um yes all of them /.
um i mean what i 've been through /-
but yes i was a cocaine addict /.
you 've beat everything /.
you 've /-
you know i mean i do n't want to sound like i 'm bragging /.
but you know i /.
sorry mom and dad too /.
you beat everything /.
ever tempted /?
are you ever are you ever tempted /?
uh but /-
yeah /. but i have i 've done them all /.
and you know i do n't know how i managed to get through my life /.
i am so lucky that you know the powers that be were looking after me /.

and the caller is from sarasota florida /.
hello /.
hi i was i 'm bipolar /.
and i 've been hospitalized /.
and i 've been through about every medication that there was /.
um and i 'm on medications now that work but have a lot of side effects /.
and i was just curious if you 'd had that same problem /.
what kind of side effects /?
um side effects /.
do you want to be more specific /?
weight gain /?
mhm mhm /.
um well weight gain which i 've taken care of i 've got that under control but like um my thyroid /.
um my hormones have gone through the roof /.
i 'm thirty - two /.
and they tell me that now i 'm menopausal because of the lithium making my hormones go up so much um /.
but the lithium is what helps you , right /?
and /-
ah /.
it does /.
um that along with another drug are the main things that control the mania /.
um the depression is the hardest thing though /.
the um the medication that i 'm on for depression is just /-
um i 've been through them all /.
we 're running close on time /.
what about side effects /?
what do you recommend /?
um /.
and /-
you know i i i would recommend to anybody going on a medicine that they learn of the side effects first so that they can combat them because nothing 's worse than than finding success with a medicine and then gaining a lot of weight /.
so what you want to do is learn of the side effects early so that you can do certain things for yourself to combat them /.
um and that 's really between you and your doctor to try to find your way through um those side effects /.
i mean you know what a terrible thing to be menopausal /.
if that means no children in your future that could be another you know devasting you know have a devastating effect /.
but you should know all these things going in and then just take them one at a time with your therapist and work on them trying to find that balance /.
